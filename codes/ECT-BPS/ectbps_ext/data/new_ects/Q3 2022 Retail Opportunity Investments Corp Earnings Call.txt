Hello, and welcome to the Retail Opportunity Investments 2022 Third Quarter Conference Call. (Operator Instructions)
Now I would like to introduce Laurie Sneve, the company's Chief Accounting Officer. You may begin.
 
Laurie A. Sneve
Retail Opportunity Investments Corp. - CAO, Senior VP & Controller
Thank you. Before we begin, please note that certain matters that will be discussed on today's call are forward-looking statements within
the meaning of federal securities laws. Although we believe that these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable
assumptions, we can give no assurance that these assumptions will be achieved. These forward-looking statements involve risks and
other factors, which can cause actual results to differ significantly from future results that are expressed or implied by such
forward-looking statements. These risks and other factors are described in the company's filings with the SEC including our most recent
annual report on Form 10-K.
Participants should refer to the company's filings to learn more about these risks and other factors as well as for more information
regarding our financial and operational results.
Now I'll turn the call over to Stuart Tanz, the company's Chief Executive Officer. Stuart?
 
Stuart A. Tanz
Retail Opportunity Investments Corp. - President, CEO & Director
Thank you, Laurie, and good morning, everyone. Here with Laurie and me today is Michael Haines, our Chief Financial Officer; and Rich
Schoebel, our Chief Operating Officer. The strong demand for space across our portfolio and our ability to capitalize on the demand
continues to be the main headline story this year for ROIC. We continue to lease space at a record pace. In fact, in just the first 9 months,
we have already leased 1.2 million square feet of space, which is a new record for the company.
Instead of leasing space at a record pace, we continue to steadily increase our overall portfolio lease rate as we move through the year.
Today, our portfolio stands at a very strong 97.8% leased. In terms of re-leasing rent growth, we are pleased to report that we -- that we
had one of the best quarters on record for the company, achieving a 48% increase in cash base rents on new leases signed during the
third quarter. With respect to renewal activity, existing tenants, especially core long-standing anchor tenants are increasingly coming to
us early to renew their leases, in some cases by as much as 9 months to a year in advance of their lease expirations. As a result, we are
renewing space at a record pace.
Turning to our investment activities, capitalizing on our long-standing off-market relationships. During the first 9 months of the year, we
acquired 5 terrific well-established grocery-anchored shopping centers, totaling $120 million, including 2 that we acquired during the
third quarter for $60 million. All 5 of the centers are well situated in densely populated, affluent residential communities and feature
strong grocery operators along with a diverse mix of in-line tenants.
The blended going-in yield on $120 million is in the low to mid-6% range. There are a number of re-leasing, repositioning and value-add
opportunities that we are already aggressively pursuing. In fact, in just a few months' time today, we have already increased the blended
lease rate on the 5 properties by approximately 200 basis points thus far.
Additionally, the new acquisitions are located within our core markets, where we have an established presence, thereby enhancing our
ability to maneuver tenants among our centers and continue capturing the strong demand for space. Looking ahead, while we continue
to keep a close eye on the acquisition market, given the current economic uncertainty and the ongoing rise in interest rates, we believe
that the prudent approach in this environment is to pause our investment activity for the time being and wait to see how the market
evolves.
Now I'll turn the call over to Michael Haines, our CFO. Mike?
 
Michael B. Haines
Retail Opportunity Investments Corp. - Executive VP, CFO, Treasurer & Secretary
Thanks, Stuart. GAAP net income attributable to common shareholders for the 3 months ended September 30, 2022, was $18.5 million,
equating to $0.15 per diluted share. And in terms of funds from operations for the third quarter, FFO totaled $36.5 million, equating to
$0.27 per diluted share, as compared to FFO of $32.6 million or $0.25 per diluted share for the 3 months ended September 30, 2021.
With respect to our financial results for the first 9 months of 2022, GAAP net income attributable to common shareholders totaled $41.7
million or $0.33 per diluted share. In terms of FFO, the company had $109.4 million in total FFO or $0.83 per diluted share for the first 9
months of 2022 as compared to FFO of $95.3 million or $0.74 per diluted share for the first 9 months of 2021.
In terms of the company's investment activities during the third quarter, we funded the acquisitions primarily through a combination of
proceeds from our property sale and free cash flow from operations. Importantly, during the third quarter, while our gross real estate
assets grew by $42 million, our total principal debt only increased by less than $6 million. As a result, our net debt to annualized EBITDA
went from 6.7x for the second quarter, down to 6.6x for the third quarter. While our shopping centers continue to perform well, in fact
ahead of our initial property level budgets thus far for 2022. At the corporate level, we are not immune to the Fed's ongoing initiative of
raising interest rates to curb inflation. Specifically, during the third quarter, the company's interest expense increased by approximately
[$300,000.]
As of September 30, approximately 26% of our total debt was floating rate. In terms of 74% is a fixed rate debt, nothing is scheduled to
mature between now and the end of 2023. And beyond that, our debt maturity schedule is well laddered. In terms of our FFO guidance
for the full year of 2022, we have narrowed our previous range of $1.08 to $1.12 per share to now be in range of $1.09 to $1.11 per share.
In anticipation of the federal raise rates again during the fourth quarter, our new guidance range takes into account [another] $1.2 million
to $1.5 million of added interest expense on top of our Q3 interest expense. Our tighter guidance range also takes into account no
additional acquisitions or dispositions between now and year-end, as Stuart noted. Lastly, our guidance range continues to assume that
same-center NOI growth will be in the 4% to 5% range for the full year. For reference, during the first 9 months of the year, same-center
NOI increased by 4.4%.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Rich Schoebel, our COO. Rich?
 
Richard K. Schoebel
Retail Opportunity Investments Corp. - COO
Thanks, Mike. As Stuart highlighted, demand for space across our portfolio continues to be strong, and we continue to make the most of
it to drive our leasing results to new heights. Specifically, the third quarter proved to be our most active year-to-date. Leasing over
480,000 square feet of space during the quarter, bringing our total leasing activity thus far for the year to 1.2 million square feet, which,
as Stuart indicated, is a new record for the company, surpassing our previous 9-month record that we achieved 4 years ago.
Additionally, our strong leasing activity continues to drive our portfolio lease rate higher. You may recall that at the end of the first
quarter, our portfolio stood at 97.2% leased, which we increased to 97.6% in the second quarter. Today, as of September 30, our
portfolio lease rate has now increased to 97.8%, which is just shy of a record high 97.9% lease rate that we achieved in 2019.
Notwithstanding being essentially fully leased, we continue to work hard at capturing the demand for space through finding creative
ways to free up space within our portfolio, primarily through a combination of recapturing space early, shifting certain tenants and
rightsizing others to make way to not only accommodate key long-standing existing tenants who are seeking to expand, but also to
create space within our portfolio to bring in more and more new destination tenants and enhance our overall tenant mix.
Just to highlight a few examples. During the third quarter, at one of our shopping centers in the Pacific Northwest, a new tenant that had
recently opened introduced us to a group that's looking to roll out a new cultural center concept on the West Coast and seeking to lease
space at our property for their inaugural location. Notwithstanding our shopping center being 100% leased, we went to work and
proactively recaptured a space early that wasn't scheduled to expire until next year. With the new lease, we are choosing a significant
increase in rent and equally important, we expect that the new tenant will become a terrific unique draw to the center. And we are
currently in discussions with the group about rolling out their cultural center concept at a number of shopping centers across our
portfolio.
To cite another example, we were recently approached by a prominent successful rock-climbing gym operator on the West Coast, who is
seeking space specifically at one of our Southern California shopping centers. However, we didn't have enough available space at the
center for their needs. Rather than turning them away, we quickly went to work maneuvering several in-line tenants and combining their
spaces with unused space at the back of the property to create the ideal space for the gym operator.
Again, we achieved an increase in rent while also bringing a great new destination tenant to our center. Additionally, at another one of
our Southern California shopping centers, we were recently approached by a national tenant seeking to lease a junior anchor space.
Again, rather than turning them away. Instead, we went to an existing anchor tenant and successfully recaptured a portion of their space,
specifically space that they had been subletting to another tenant. The new lease with a new national tenant is at a significantly higher
rent and we're able to structure the deal such that there is effectively no downtime in terms of rent and only requires a minimum amount
of TIs for the new tenant.
Along with these new tenants seeking space, a growing number of our existing restaurant tenants continue to come to us seeking to
expand their spaces to accommodate additional seating areas as well as new bar spaces, and they are looking to extend their lease
terms. In addition to these traditional dine-in restaurants seeking to expand their spaces, a broad range of food service businesses
continue to seek out our shopping centers looking to open new grab-and-go concepts, which are proving to be very popular and
profitable. We continue to work creatively to bring these new tenants into our portfolio.
In terms of renewal activity, as Stuart noted, we continue to have a very active, successful year. Specifically, year-to-date, we've already
renewed 884,000 square feet of space including renewing 349,000 square feet of space in the third quarter alone. And as Stuart
touched on, a growing number of existing tenants are coming to us early to take down their options, especially as it relates to key anchor
tenants. In fact, of the 182,000 square feet of anchor space that we renewed during the third quarter, over 3/4 of that were anchor
tenants with leases not due to be renewed until next year.
Lastly, in terms of lease versus build, during the third quarter, new tenants representing approximately $1.4 million in annual base rent
opened and commenced paying rent, bringing our total thus far for the year to $6.1 million of annual base rent from newly opened
tenants. In terms of additional new leases signed, given our strong leasing activity, during the third quarter, we signed new leases
representing an aggregate $2.7 million of annual base rent. Taking this into account, as of September 30, we have approximately $9.1
million of annual base rent from new tenants that haven't yet taken occupancy and commenced paying rent. We continue to work
diligently at getting these new tenants open expeditiously.
Now I'll turn the call back over to Stuart.
 
Stuart A. Tanz
Retail Opportunity Investments Corp. - President, CEO & Director
Thanks, Rich. As the fourth quarter gets underway, thus far, we are on track to post another solid quarter of leasing as the demand for
space continues to be strong. In fact, at a recent West Coast ICSC conference in San Diego a few weeks ago, we had a number of very
productive meetings with both existing and prospective new tenants. Many of them focused and ready to strike deals considerably more
so than what we've seen in the past few years. We think this bodes well both in terms of finishing 2022 strong on the leasing front and in
terms of building good momentum heading into 2023.
Finally, notwithstanding current REIT stock prices, the fundamental drivers, both near term and long term of our West Coast
grocery-anchored portfolio remains sound. Near term, we believe that the current demand for space will continue to provide a wealth of
opportunities for our team to enhance value through our proactive hands-on approach of working our shopping centers and tenant base.
We expect to continue driving rental rates and same-center NOI steadily higher while also working to further our tenant diversity, which
is the cornerstone of our business.
Long term, our core West Coast markets continue to be among the most demographically strong and diverse markets in the country.
Also, our markets continue to be among the most protected supply constraint in the country as well. We believe that these distinct
attributes are what will continue to make our markets among the most sought after by a broad range of tenants and investors alike.
Additionally, we believe these factors will continue to serve as the foundational strength and appeal of our West Coast grocery-anchored
portfolio, as well as enhance our ability to continue building value for years to come.
Now we'll open up the call for your questions. Operator?
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Juan Sanabria with BMO.
 
Juan Carlos Sanabria
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - MD & Senior U.S. Real Estate Analyst
I was just hoping to understand guidance a little bit better. You kept it the same tight in the range. But here you had a couple, I guess,
different or opposing forces [want] to hit higher rates as some of the swaps expired. I'm not sure what that impact is to the fourth
quarter, it had great leasing. I was just curious as well as higher noncash rental income expectations for the year now. I was just hoping
maybe you could talk a little bit about guidance and the puts and takes. And specifically, what kind of occupancy or build -- occupancy
we should expect by year-end just to think about how that $9 million comes online of build but not commenced or at least not
commenced, sorry.
 
Michael B. Haines
Retail Opportunity Investments Corp. - Executive VP, CFO, Treasurer & Secretary
Quite a few questions in a question. Let's address the gap of build versus lease, that $9.1 million, we expected the large majority of it to
come online by June, a large chunk of it is supposed to actually start this quarter in Q4 2022. So -- and as far as the guidance goes,
interest expense did go up, obviously, because of the swaps matured, but we expect that revenue in the fourth quarter will increase as a
result of owning the new acquisitions for a full quarter, along with the new tenants that were expected to take occupancy during the
quarter. So that's kind of -- one of the drivers' kind of offsetting the interest expense increase.
And if you look at the guidance table in the press release also, you'll note that FAS 141 revenue is up a little bit in the fourth quarter, and
that's from the purchase price allocations from the assets we acquired in August. Our bad debt was lowered a little bit, kind of tracking
where we are for the year. And our G&A, I think, came down on the higher end as well. So a lot of small moving parts that kind of get you
to a relatively stable fourth quarter.
 
Juan Carlos Sanabria
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - MD & Senior U.S. Real Estate Analyst
Okay. Great. And then just on the balance sheet, I guess, what is the plan at this point with -- you've got 26% floating, which you talked
about, and you've got an expiration coming up at the end of '23 and how we should think about those 2 pieces moving forward and how
you plan to manage the risk around that?
 
Michael B. Haines
Retail Opportunity Investments Corp. - Executive VP, CFO, Treasurer & Secretary
Well, as far as the term loan growth. The term loan doesn't mature until 2025. So there's ample time for the market to kind of evolve and
settle down. I'm not sure where it's all going right now, but ideally would like to refinance the term loan with public bonds, along with
perhaps paying down a portion of the loan depending on market conditions. And then there's the bonds that are due December of next
year. Again, we've got some time left on that. And you have to remember that that's at a little over 5% coupon. So I'm not sure how the
rate environment will be next year, what might be a push, and we will have to kind of wait and see.
 
Unidentified Company Representative

Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Todd Thomas with KeyBanc.
 
Todd Michael Thomas
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division - MD & Senior Equity Research Analyst
Stuart, I just wanted to first ask, I realize guidance assumes nothing else during the year in terms of investments, but just wanted to get
an update from you on the current thinking around investments heading into '23 with regard to your appetite and the ability to deploy
capital on an accretive basis in the current environment.
 
Stuart A. Tanz
Retail Opportunity Investments Corp. - President, CEO & Director
Sure. Well, I mean, currently, the market is really in what we would call a pause situation where there's really very little transactional
activity going on at the present time. A lot of buyers and sellers are taking a wait-and-see approach in terms of the economic uncertainty
and interest rates. As it relates to '23, we're obviously going to keep our ear to the ground in terms of opportunities, if cap rates haven't
really moved up much for our product, but there's not much product on the market either. So we'll continue to monitor the market and
obviously continue to look at some properties that are on the market in terms of dispositions to help fund some potential acquisitions.
But right now, the view is to really be patient. And so as we head into '23, we'll continue to monitor things very closely. And as the
opportunities do, if we do find a couple of opportunities that were there, then we'll look at those opportunities and decide how we'll fund
them when that time comes.
 
Todd Michael Thomas
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division - MD & Senior Equity Research Analyst
Okay. Are you anticipating an increase in cap rates or any -- an increase in required returns as you kind of talk to folks and think about
the next several quarters moving forward?
 
Stuart A. Tanz
Retail Opportunity Investments Corp. - President, CEO & Director
I'm anticipating some movement in cap rates, but for high-quality grocery-anchored shopping centers right now, cap rates really haven't
moved much. And there's no real benchmark right now to look at as it relates to where those cap rates might go.
 
Todd Michael Thomas
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division - MD & Senior Equity Research Analyst
Okay. And then just a clarification. I think you said for the 5 year-to-date acquisitions, about $120 million. I think you said that the initial
yield was in the low to mid-6% range. But I thought you mentioned after that you've already increased the yield on those acquisitions by
200 basis points. Can you just clarify that comment? And maybe I misunderstood, but just curious what the initial yield was and maybe
what the current yield was on that -- on those acquisitions? It sounds like there was a little bit of lease-up and value-add that may have
already materialized.
 
Richard K. Schoebel
Retail Opportunity Investments Corp. - COO
Yes. I mean it's primarily around as you touched on the lease-up. We've found that in certain circumstances, these properties have been
under-managed and our team well in advance of closing has gone out and secured tenants. And spaces that had sat for the prior owner
were leased up almost immediately upon closing. So that's what's driving that.
 
Stuart A. Tanz
Retail Opportunity Investments Corp. - President, CEO & Director
And the impact of that 100 -- or excuse me, 250 basis points really won't be felt obviously to the first and second quarter of next year
because that's when the income will come online from a rent perspective.
 
Todd Michael Thomas
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division - MD & Senior Equity Research Analyst
Okay. Got it. So the low to mid-6% cap rate, that was the initial yield, the NOI yield at closing, you're expecting about a 250 basis point
uplift over the next couple of quarters?
 
Unidentified Company Representative
Correct.
 
Todd Michael Thomas
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division - MD & Senior Equity Research Analyst
Okay. And then just lastly, Mike, on the swaps, I just want to make sure I understand -- so right now, there is no plan to implement any
interest rate swaps or hedge the exposure at all on the $300 million of term loans. Is that right?
 
Michael B. Haines
Retail Opportunity Investments Corp. - Executive VP, CFO, Treasurer & Secretary
That's correct. For right now, for the short term, we're going to allow them to remain floating and kind of see how the rate environment
evolves.
 
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Craig Mailman with Citi.
 
Craig Allen Mailman
Citigroup Inc. Exchange Research - Research Analyst
Stuart, I just want to circle back to the leasing side of things. You guys have clearly been pulling forward some renewals here with good
rent spreads. I'm just kind of curious your just thought process on trying to delay that or to let rents continue to rise or if you guys are
more concerned about the leasing environment over the next 6 months? And I just want to put this in the bag. I'm just trying to
understand your broader macro framework in general?
 
Stuart A. Tanz
Retail Opportunity Investments Corp. - President, CEO & Director
Sure. Well, maybe we'll comment -- I'll comment on the anchor spaces first, Rich. I mean we have a number of anchors coming due in '23
and the focus from our perspective has been able to stay ahead of that curve. And when I say that, the focus has been to go to some of
these anchor tenants that are doing extremely well at our centers and getting more term than just their typical 5-year option. So that's
been one of our goals looking out over the last 60 to 90 days in terms of these anchor renewals.
These tenants have come to us earlier than usual. But the goal is to really what I would say, stagger now some of these leases. So 5 years
from now, we don't have the same impact. So that's been one of our goals over the last 60 to 90 days from the anchor perspective. And
the number of those leases have fixed increases, of course, because they are contractual auctions. Do you want to comment on the in-line
space?
 
Richard K. Schoebel
Retail Opportunity Investments Corp. - COO
Sure. I mean I think we understand the value of our real estate. And so when we're doing these leases, while a tenant may be trying to get
the best deal they can, we also know what the market is for the space. So we're not leaving any dollars on the table, but occupancy is an
important factor for us. And as you see with our historic occupancy, that's always a factor that we keep in mind. But I don't feel like we're
leaving any money on the table.
 
Craig Allen Mailman
Citigroup Inc. Exchange Research - Research Analyst
Are you guys -- go ahead.
 
Stuart A. Tanz
Retail Opportunity Investments Corp. - President, CEO & Director
And there's been no sign of any weakness from our tenant base at all, that's the other thing to point out, Craig.
 
Craig Allen Mailman
Citigroup Inc. Exchange Research - Research Analyst
That's helpful. And I just wanted to -- first, given kind of the early option execution here? I mean are you guys trying to put through -- or
let me answer it this way, what are you guys trying to get out of it? Are you trying to push to higher bumps? Are you guys trying to get less
restrictions that may be in some of these leases outside of just pure rent bumps, are you guys able to get anything on the concession side
that is beneficial to longer term?
 
Stuart A. Tanz
Retail Opportunity Investments Corp. - President, CEO & Director
The answer is yes. And when I say that, it's really depending on the situation. But the reality is that we have a number of anchor leases
that don't have much term left and these tenants have come to us and wanted a lot more (inaudible) doing so, we have approached them
to do a number of other things like deal with -- although we don't -- we have very little co-tenancy, but things like ESG related as well as
exclusive and other things. So the answer is absolutely yes. That has been part of our negotiation with these anchor tenants.
 
Craig Allen Mailman
Citigroup Inc. Exchange Research - Research Analyst
Okay. And then just I noticed on the renewal side, TIs were up pretty markedly this quarter, especially on the anchor side of things. Is that
skewed by a lease or 2? Or is that -- what's going on there?
 
Richard K. Schoebel
Retail Opportunity Investments Corp. - COO
I think that, again, every deal is specific and sometimes it's driven by maybe we're recapturing a portion of the space, and so there's a bit
higher cost relative to splitting utilities and that sort of thing. But that's obviously offset by the increase in rent that we're going to
receive. So the return on those dollars is quite nice.
 
Nicholas Gregory Joseph
Citigroup Inc., Research Division - Director & Senior Analyst
It's Nick Joseph here with Craig. Just one more on the transaction market. I understand the pullback, but how wide is that bid-ask spread
for high-quality assets today?
 
Stuart A. Tanz
Retail Opportunity Investments Corp. - President, CEO & Director
How is the bid spread, tough to answer the question because there's not much going on in the market at the present time as it relates to
what that bid-ask spread might be. I would tell you that certainly, some of the deals that have been in the pipeline that have closed more
recently have really had very little -- we've seen very little impact from a cap rate perspective. But in terms of the bid-ask, it's just too
early to tell and there's very little transactional activity going on to give you an answer. Let's wait another quarter. And I think certainly,
we should have more clarity on that front.
 
Nicholas Gregory Joseph
Citigroup Inc., Research Division - Director & Senior Analyst
I guess how much have you moved up your return hurdles if you were to do an acquisition today?
 
Stuart A. Tanz
Retail Opportunity Investments Corp. - President, CEO & Director
It depends on the asset and it depends on the growth of the NOI in terms of looking at the asset and what it might deliver longer term.
But certainly, given the cost of capital that has gone up for all of us, our expectation has certainly gone up at least 100 basis points.
 
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Craig Schmidt with Bank of America.
 
Craig Richard Schmidt
BofA Securities, Research Division - Director
It just sounds from your comments that the leasing still remains elevated and the activity into the fourth quarter. I'm just wondering how
much of 2023 leasing has already been completed.
 
Richard K. Schoebel
Retail Opportunity Investments Corp. - COO
Well, a significant portion of the anchor leases that were scheduled to expire next year have been completed, and we're making good
progress on the shop tenant side as well. I don't have a specific percentage for you in front of me, but it's very similar to years past where
tenants are coming to us, looking to renew and secure longer term. So very healthy.
 
Craig Richard Schmidt
BofA Securities, Research Division - Director
Great. And then the run rate for operating -- property operating expenses have been double digit. Are you expecting that to continue at
that pace? Or could it actually increase?
 
Stuart A. Tanz
Retail Opportunity Investments Corp. - President, CEO & Director
On the expense side, he is asking.
 
Unidentified Company Representative
Understood. I think that...
 
Craig Richard Schmidt
BofA Securities, Research Division - Director
It was up 10.2% -- Yes, it was up 10.2% -- I think your -- to date, it's up 12.9%. I'm just wondering given inflationary pressures and
whatnot, that could hold a bit that lower double-digit name or could they increase?
 
Stuart A. Tanz
Retail Opportunity Investments Corp. - President, CEO & Director
Well, I think costs in general have gone up across the board, primarily, Craig, as it relates to utility and security in some cases. That's
what's driving some of that increase in the expense. But some of that, I believe, is going to begin to level off from an inflation perspective.
And as we wrapped up budgets for '23, that number certainly not as high as what you've seen to date as it relates to the budgeting
process.
 
Craig Richard Schmidt
BofA Securities, Research Division - Director
Okay. Great. And just finally, have you had any conversations with either Kroger or Albertsons since they announced their plans to
merge?
 
Stuart A. Tanz
Retail Opportunity Investments Corp. - President, CEO & Director
The answer is, we haven't spoken to them in a couple of months now. I know why they will not return to our calls but the good news is
Rich and I are set to get on the phone with both of these tenants over the next week to 2 weeks. So we'll be able to reconnect with them
with obviously the focus on the relationship and the stores we've got with them. But no, we have not spoken with them recently, but we
will be having conversations with them over the week to 2 weeks. I don't think there's much they can say at this point. I would assume
there's still in somewhat of a quiet period.
 
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Michael Gorman with BTIG.
 
Michael Patrick Gorman
BTIG, LLC, Research Division - MD & REIT Analyst
Most of my questions have been answered, but I just wanted to have a quick follow-up on the expense side, just as we were looking at the
run rate, I understand inflation and everything. But looks like recoveries have been lagging the actual expense growth. So I'm just
wondering, is it the specific categories that are growing on the expense side that aren't being reimbursed or recovered from tenants? Or
any color on why there's the differential there between the recovery growth and the expense growth?
 
Richard K. Schoebel
Retail Opportunity Investments Corp. - COO
I think there's been a few initiatives we've done this year as we've expanded some of our ESG initiatives that we will recoup over time as
those initiatives reduce expenses. But some of those initiatives do have caps or other things where anchor tenant may not participate. But
we still see it as a positive for the long term because those overall expenses will come down as things like LED conversions go in place
and solar and other things like that water efficiencies. So there's a bit of a front-end cost on that, that's probably impacting that number.
 
Michael Patrick Gorman
BTIG, LLC, Research Division - MD & REIT Analyst
Got it. Got it. That's helpful. And then, Stuart, maybe just going back for a minute and talking a little bit more about the transaction
environment. I know in recent quarters that there's been kind of a tailwind to demand not only from retail investment but also from
demand for housing developers and apartment communities and things like that. Can you talk about any impact that you're seeing from
that side of things? Any change in demand there because of what's going on in the capital markets or what's going on with kind of
expectations for housing in your markets?
 
Stuart A. Tanz
Retail Opportunity Investments Corp. - President, CEO & Director
Yes. No, things continue to be strong from the -- on the housing front. Certainly, the housing market has slowed down. The one
interesting point to probably tell you in terms of what I've learned more recently is that unentitled land seems to be gaining more value
right now than entitled land because of the timetable out there as it relates to the economic environment. But from a housing
perspective, things are extremely strong at West. We haven't really seen any real slowdown. Pricing has stabilized, but it really hasn't
changed much. And the demographics in terms of our assets continue to get better because as more density gets built, it's certainly
getting -- bringing a lot more customers to our centers. So from a data perspective, traffic continues to gain good momentum.
 
Michael Patrick Gorman
BTIG, LLC, Research Division - MD & REIT Analyst
Great. That's helpful. And then maybe one other question as we're going through this pause. You certainly have a lot of connections in
the marketplace and have your finger on the pulse. Any sense for any, I'll call it, kind of pending stress or pending distress from some
owners out there where maybe there's a big CapEx burden that's coming up or a big vacancy or re-leasing where maybe right now,
they're okay waiting to see where the market shakes out. But in the next 6 to 9 months, they're going to have to hit the marketplace and
may provide more opportunities?
 
Stuart A. Tanz
Retail Opportunity Investments Corp. - President, CEO & Director
The answer is, yes. I am beginning to get some calls and some e-mails from some owners that have some financing coming up from their
perspective and/or CapEx issues. So we're beginning -- we're at the early, early stages of beginning to see some cracks out there, Mike.
So nothing too dramatic right now, but the answer is yes. I am beginning to see a bit of friction out there as it relates to owners that are
looking out late next year and have potentially some issues that they're looking at. So it's beginning to show a bit, but nothing yet --
nothing like we've seen in '08 or '09, of course. But the answer is yes, I am beginning to get some e-mail, some traffic, as you would say.
 
Michael Patrick Gorman
BTIG, LLC, Research Division - MD & REIT Analyst
Great. And having lived through '08, '09. I'm glad to hear it's not looking like that yet. So I appreciate the time.

Our next question comes from the line of Wesley Golladay with Baird.
 
Wesley Keith Golladay
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst
Can you just give us an update on the land sales? I know you had a pipeline that you're aggregating. You were going to break ground on
one project up north in Bellevue with the cost of capital rising, any appetite to either pause that, just to outright monetize the asset at
this moment?
 
Stuart A. Tanz
Retail Opportunity Investments Corp. - President, CEO & Director
Yes. Maybe I'll just quickly start out with Crossroads. I mean certainly, we're still in the permitting process. We're expected to be in a
position to start construction certainly as we move towards the first quarter. But given the current economic uncertainty, we are
considering possibly holding off on breaking ground on that project. In terms of the other projects, the great -- the good news is that we
did get final entitlements in Panola last week, and Nevada was also moving along quite well, and we're in the midst of beginning to
move 1 of the 2 to the market over the next several weeks. We think we'll -- we think there's a pretty good chance of transacting there.
And then as it relates to any other properties like that are in the pipeline, we're just continuing to work those as it relates to entitlements.
But that's what's going on as it relates to both the Crossroads and the other 2 properties.
 
Wesley Keith Golladay
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst
Okay. And then you mentioned there was really no weakness in the tenant base. One of the companies we're watching is Rite Aid. I know
it's a big tenant. You're actually taking on a little bit more exposure by the acquisitions this year that seems to be more of a capital
structure issue, but could you provide some, I guess, qualitative commentary on how you feel about the portfolio exposure there, whether
it's below market rents, productive locations. Just any kind of context for us?
 
Unidentified Company Representative
Sure. Rich, do you want to add?
 
Richard K. Schoebel
Retail Opportunity Investments Corp. - COO
Sure. Yes, I mean, Rite Aid only accounts for about 1.7% of our total base rent. It's derived from about 16 leases that are spread
throughout our portfolio. All the locations seem to be performing well. Many of these leases are significantly below market, so it may
present some opportunities for us as well. So we don't -- we're not concerned about Rite Aid.
 
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of R.J. Milligan with Raymond James.
 
Richard Jon Milligan
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - Director & Research Analyst
I just want to expand on the question of the sign, but not open and the cadence. You expect that both -- that they come online by June,
but you're also adding that bucket with the leasing you're doing today. So obviously, that's more rent online, maybe in the back half of '23
and into '24. So I guess I'm just trying to gauge how long the runway is for growth on what's been signed in 3Q, what will be signed in 4Q,
and curious if that implies healthy growth in 2024 barring any major credit issues?
 
Richard K. Schoebel
Retail Opportunity Investments Corp. - COO
Yes. I mean I think overall, it's a positive story here. As you touch on, we commenced a significant amount of rent in the quarter, but we
also added to the bucket. And the good news on some of the things we've added to the bucket as we touched on the prepared remarks is
some of this has got fixed rent commencement dates. So we're not at the mercy of permits and things like that. But always going to be
certain leases that take longer to get commenced because as I touched on earlier, maybe we're recapturing a portion of an anchor space
and you've now got to demise it, that just takes a bit longer than just delivering a space as is.
 
Richard Jon Milligan
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - Director & Research Analyst
I guess what I'm trying to get at is if the leasing stops today, doesn't -- given what's signed but not opened, doesn't imply pretty healthy
growth over the course of 2023?
 
Unidentified Company Representative
Yes, you're saying we did no more leasing.
 
Michael B. Haines
Retail Opportunity Investments Corp. - Executive VP, CFO, Treasurer & Secretary
Yes, I suppose if it stopped today, the $9.1 million as the bulk of it is just to start between now and June. So is that -- I mean they start
paying rent, so these will get a full run rate all the way through 2023 in that regard. And of course, we're obviously going to be doing
more leasing activity this quarter and into the first quarter after the year-end. So the bucket will always be being replenished. It just
depends on what volume it's going to be replenished depending on market conditions. We don't see any cracks or any signs of weakness
now.

Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan.
 
Michael William Mueller
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst
A couple of questions. So the first one, what was the average escalator baked into your leases that you signed year-to-date? And the
second question, you talked about and granted spotty data out there, but your thought that grocery cap rates have been, I don't know,
somewhat sticky -- sticky with rates going up. But out of curiosity, I mean, do you think that grocery cap rates can be below the long-term
financing cost over a multiyear period?
 
Stuart A. Tanz
Retail Opportunity Investments Corp. - President, CEO & Director
Well, I'll try to answer the first -- the second part of your question first in terms of cap rates. I think it depends -- I think we're entering a
different time right now where the grocery drug anchor format has become the most sought after in terms of capital, both private and
institutional. Whether that has a long-term impact in terms of valuation or the stickiness as you might say is probably going to -- the
answer is yes. I think it's going to have some impact.
Certainly, as it relates to where cap rates might move for other types of retail real estate. So we could be in a different place right now
looking into -- as interest rates do go up, where owners today, as I speak with them, seem very comfortable, [key only in] what they have,
and that's why the transactional market has slowed dramatically because the fundamentals of what's different this time around, Mike, is
the fundamentals are so strong, and yet the cost of debt capital has gone up a lot.
So I think what you're going to see as we move into '23 is an environment where there'll be a lot less transactions occurring for this
product type, which will keep cap rates quite compressed. And so that's why -- and try to answer your question, I think we're in a different
sort of secular change here. How dramatic that change is, I can't tell you at this moment. Certainly, cap rates are going to go up a bit, but
I think you're not going to see a one-to-one sort of change as you've seen in the past, just because the fundamentals are just so strong.
 
Richard K. Schoebel
Retail Opportunity Investments Corp. - COO
And then in terms of the -- yes, in terms of the rent escalators, I mean, I think historically, as we've talked about, for the shop tenants, it's
been typically around 3% annually. And for the anchors, 10% or 12% every 5 years. But we're cognizant of inflation. And I think tenants
are -- that's driving some of the demand tenants wanting to come in and lock in rents. But we are pushing more for 5% annually on the
shop spaces and more like in the 15% every 5 years for the anchors.

Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Lucas with Capital One.
 
Christopher Ronald Lucas
Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division - Senior VP & Lead Equity Research Analyst
I have a number of follow-ups. So let me just get through them pretty quickly. Stuart, just on the development side that you had
mentioned, I guess, Panola had gotten its approvals for the zoning you needed. Is that a first half of next year, sort of event, do you think?
 
Stuart A. Tanz
Retail Opportunity Investments Corp. - President, CEO & Director
In terms of the sale of the asset, I think, is your question.
 
Christopher Ronald Lucas
Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division - Senior VP & Lead Equity Research Analyst
Yes.
 
Stuart A. Tanz
Retail Opportunity Investments Corp. - President, CEO & Director
I can't -- the answer is, it could be -- we don't know yet because we're just in the midst of bringing it to the market. I think we will
transact, but this is probably a first quarter event versus a fourth quarter event.
 
Christopher Ronald Lucas
Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division - Senior VP & Lead Equity Research Analyst
And then I guess, Rich, on tenant fallout just generally, how would you compare '22 to sort of '18 or '19? And then given what you've done
so far in terms of getting ahead of the '23 expirations, how does '23 stack up relative to '22?
 
Richard K. Schoebel
Retail Opportunity Investments Corp. - COO
Yes. I mean I think that in terms of tenant fallout, it's sort of back to the pre-pandemic levels. I think that the reality is that COVID created
a shakeout, the weak tenants have fallen out. And we don't see any additional weakness beyond what you might have seen prior to the
pandemic.
 
Christopher Ronald Lucas
Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division - Senior VP & Lead Equity Research Analyst
So for any of the anchors that have -- for next year that haven't renewed, is that more of a timing process for you guys at this point? Or do
you think there's some risk there?
 
Richard K. Schoebel
Retail Opportunity Investments Corp. - COO
No. I mean I think of the anchor leases remain for next year, there's about 17 of them scheduled to expire. And based on our early
discussions with them, we are anticipating that at least 13 of those will be renewing. The majority of those are the grocery and drug
stores. The remaining leases, we're in discussions with them, but it's a little bit too early to say for sure that they're going to renew. And
there may be an opportunity there where we actually don't want them to renew. And that's why we're discussing with them how much
will they pay.
 
Stuart A. Tanz
Retail Opportunity Investments Corp. - President, CEO & Director
Yes. I mean I think, Chris, this could be an opportunity for us because, as you know, we've had such -- we had no anchor vacancy for a
period of time. And given the demand and how strong the demand is, I look at this potentially as an opportunity next year if we -- if one
of these tenants do fall out.
 
Christopher Ronald Lucas
Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division - Senior VP & Lead Equity Research Analyst
Okay. Okay. And then I guess -- maybe just taking a step back as it relates to sort of the -- sort of natural tension between landlords and
tenants in terms of who's got more leverage. Is that changing at all from where it was, say, end of last year or early part of this year?
 
Stuart A. Tanz
Retail Opportunity Investments Corp. - President, CEO & Director
Well, the pendulum has certainly swung back to the landlord pretty quickly coming out of the pandemic. That's for sure, Rich.
 
Richard K. Schoebel
Retail Opportunity Investments Corp. - COO
Yes. Given our West Coast focus and the fact that there's been virtually no new products brought to the market and our grocery
drug-anchored focus, our centers continue to be in very high demand. We have multiple tenants buying for spaces as they come
available. So we're not seeing any falloff in the demand side.
 
Christopher Ronald Lucas
Capital One Securities, Inc., Research Division - Senior VP & Lead Equity Research Analyst
Okay. And then last question for me, and I apologize if I missed the -- this was covered in the initial comments, but -- the large rent
spread for the non-anchor for the quarter, the 60.6%. Is that driven off of one specific lease? Or was there a handful of leases that were
that strong?
 
Richard K. Schoebel
Retail Opportunity Investments Corp. - COO
It was a handful of leases. Some of them were quite significant as we were bringing in much better tenants and re-leasing them. And
we've got more that's happening as we speak right now. So there's still some significant leases that are significantly below market that
we're recapturing and finding tenants that will pay a market rent for them.

We have a follow-up from the line of Juan Sanabria.
 
Juan Carlos Sanabria
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - MD & Senior U.S. Real Estate Analyst
Just curious on the same-store NOI guidance, which was maintained. The growth understandably has slowed throughout the course of
the year, but the midpoint would imply a reacceleration in that growth and maybe that's related to some of the leased deals
commencing. Just curious if you can give us any sense of where within the range you feel most comfortable and what would -- how we
should expect the trajectory relative to what you've reported to date for same-store NOI before the fourth quarter?
 
Unidentified Company Representative
Commencement -- lease commencement.
 
Michael B. Haines
Retail Opportunity Investments Corp. - Executive VP, CFO, Treasurer & Secretary
Yes. So we're 4.4% year-to-date through September. We maintained the goal post of 4% to 5%. And that's largely because our Q4
budgeted same-store is notably stronger than the first 3 quarters. So if that comes to fruition, which we expect it to, we'll still be well
within that 4% to 5% range, probably I'm thinking midpoint or even higher than 4.5%. So we'll see. But we feel very comfortable given
what we budgeted for Q4 as same-store NOI.
 
Juan Carlos Sanabria
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - MD & Senior U.S. Real Estate Analyst
Great. And then just one quick follow-up. I mean the Kroger-Albertsons deal. Just curious on how you see the leasing dynamics changing
with them. You may be in a position where you have a significantly larger, more powerful tenant and what that may mean to your ability
to continue to drive some of the clauses to be more favorable to you? Or were you just view it positively given you probably have a better
capitalized tenant at the end of the day? .
 
Stuart A. Tanz
Retail Opportunity Investments Corp. - President, CEO & Director
Yes, I mean, look, long term, we think the Kroger-Albertsons merger would potentially be beneficial from our perspective. We currently
have 21 shopping centers with Albertsons and 11 centers with a Kroger store. So only 32 properties out of our 93 have a impact in terms of
the Kroger-Albertsons transaction. But these 32 stores are diversified across 3 states.
And within these states, these stores are diversified evenly in terms of ABR and across multiple metro markets, including L.A., Orange
County, Portland and Seattle. And within these markets, these stores are specifically located in distinct separate submarket
communities. And the other thing is that these stores operate under 7 different banners. So we're -- as we look at this transaction, we -- a
lot of these stores are solid performers. In fact -- on average, if you were to average sales of all of these stores, these 32 stores, these
stores are doing on average in excess of $630 a square foot in sales.
And then lastly, the 32 leases are certainly below market on average, with some of these significantly below market. And again, shopping
centers that are well located in highly desirable affluent communities. So strong demand for the space if something were to happen. And
there's a lot of demand out there from value-oriented and specialty grocers in these locations. So if Albertsons and Kroger divest off
some of these locations, we view this as a potential opportunity. And then as you just touched on, the last thing is credit. This is certainly
going to improve the overall credit in terms of owning these anchor tenants or this particular anchor tenant in our portfolio.
