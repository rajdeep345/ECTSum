Operator
Good afternoon, and welcome to the Global Net Lease Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions)
I would now like to turn the conference over to Curtis Parker, Senior Vice President. Please go ahead.
 
Unidentified Company Representative
Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for GNL's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. This call is being webcast
in the Investor Relations section of GNL's website at www.globalnetlease.com. Joining me today on the call to discuss this quarter's
results are Jim Nelson, GNL's Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Masterson, GNL's Chief Financial Officer.
The following information contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Should one or more of these
risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.
We refer all of you to our SEC filings, including the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, filed on February 24, 2022, and all
other filings with the SEC after that date for a more detailed discussion of the risk factors that could cause these differences.
Any forward-looking statements provided during this conference call are only made as of the date of this call. As stated in our SEC
filings, GNL disclaims any intent or obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements, except as required by law.
Also during today's call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe can be useful in evaluating the company's
financial performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in
accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available in our earnings
release and supplement, which are posted to our website. Please also refer to our earnings release for more information about what we
consider to be implied investment-grade tenants, a term we will use throughout today's call.
I'll now turn the call over to our CEO, Jim Nelson. Jim?
 
James Larry Nelson
Global Net Lease, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Thanks, Curtis, and thank you to everyone for joining us on today's call. Our high-quality, mission-critical net lease office and industrial
portfolio continues to perform well. We are advancing our differentiated international and domestic strategy by increasing portfolio
concentration in industrial and distribution assets, successfully extending and expanding leases, maintaining 99% occupancy and
building a pipeline of attractive acquisitions.
Since the beginning of 2020, over 82% of GNL's acquisitions have been industrial and distribution assets, increasing GNL's ownership of
this asset class to 56% of the portfolio. We believe our best-in-class portfolio is well positioned for meaningful capital appreciation and
that our dividend provides shareholders a very compelling current yield.
In the third quarter, core FFO grew by 9.6% year-over-year to $48.3 million or $0.47 per share, and AFFO was $41.3 million or $0.40 per
share. On a constant currency basis, when we applied the average monthly currency rates from the second quarter 2022, revenues would
have been up by $1.2 million to $93.8 million. Using the same constant currency concept year-over-year, revenues would have been up by
$4.9 million to $97.5 million. Our AFFO was impacted by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro and pound. However,
our comprehensive hedging program helped reduce the impact of the strengthening and we realized $2.4 million of gains this quarter.
We think our unique global capabilities, strong balance sheet and best-in-class real estate assets continue to support GNL's positive
performance. One of our areas of focus for 2022 is asset management, and we continue to build leasing momentum. In the third quarter,
we completed 2 lease renewals and 1 tenant expansion project totaling nearly 850,000 square feet, bringing our year-to-date activity to
3.6 million square feet. We also signed 1 small new lease for a convenience store in the U.K.
The year-to-date renewal and expansion leasing adds $117 million of net new straight-line rent over the new weighted average remaining
lease term of 9.3 years, up from 3.5 years. The leases signed in the first 9 months of 2022 are for properties the company owns in the
U.S., U.K., France and the Netherlands and include investment-grade tenants such as the U.S. government, the state of Indiana, FedEx
and Whirlpool. Thanks to our leasing efforts, our portfolio has only 1% of leasing expiring during the balance of this year with almost 74%
of our leases not expiring until 2027 or later.
Building on the strong relationships we have established with our tenants over time, our asset management team has been very
successful signing leases this year in North America and Europe. At the quarter end, our 4.4 billion 310-property portfolio had a weighted
average remaining lease term of 8.1 years. Geographically, 236 of our properties are located in the U.S. and Canada and 74 are in the
U.K. and Western Europe, representing 66% and 34% of annualized straight-line rent revenue, respectively. Our portfolio is well
diversified with approximately 141 tenants in 51 industries with no single industry representing more than 12% of the whole portfolio and
no tenant exceeding 5% of the portfolio based on annual straight-line rent.
Over 94% of our leases feature annual rental increases, which increased the cash rent that is due over time from these leases. Based on
straight-line rent, approximately 64% of our leases feature fixed rate escalations, 25.6 have escalations that are based on the consumer
price index and 4.7 have escalations based on other measures. As we mentioned, we continue to expand the concentration of industrial
properties in our portfolio.
At the end of the third quarter, our assets were composed of 56% industrial/distribution, 41% office and 3% retail compared to 52%
industrial/distribution, 43% office and 5% retail at the end of the third quarter of 2021. Contributing to our success is our focus on tenant
credit, industrial acquisitions and noncore retail dispositions over the last several years. Across the portfolio, over 61% of annual
straight-line rent comes from investment-grade or implied investment-grade tenants.
Year-to-date, we have completed $33.3 million in acquisitions after a very active year of having properties in 2021. And in anticipation of
increased market uncertainty as inflation rates continue to rise, we became increasingly selective in 2022. The disconnect and spreads
sellers were asking for relative to our disciplined acquisition criteria also made many opportunities less attractive. Our selectivity has
proven to be prudent as our acquisitions pipeline as October 31 is comprised of a $32 million office property at a much more attractive
cap rate than were available at the beginning of the year.
If consistent with our disciplined acquisition criteria, we decided to close on the properties in the pipeline when combined with the
properties we have already acquired, our acquisitions for 2022 would be $66 million at a weighted average cap rate of 7.6% with 11.7
years of lease term remaining. We also sold 1 property in the U.S. during the third quarter and have agreed to terms to sell 2 additional
properties that would bring total dispositions closed or under agreement to over $110 million.
Our differentiated investment strategy continues to deliver value and we remain focused on growing our portfolio by acquiring highly
dependable single-tenant industrial and distribution properties in North America and Europe. Our successful lease renewals and
expansions speak to the mission-critical nature of the properties that we own, where over 61% of rent is derived from investment-grade
tenants and where the weighted average remaining lease term exceeds 8 years. We are well positioned for the future, and I look forward
to building on our progress through the rest of the year.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Chris to walk through the financial results in more detail before I follow up with some closing remarks.
Chris?
 
Christopher J. Masterson
Global Net Lease, Inc. - CFO, Treasurer & Secretary
Thanks, Jim. For the third quarter of 2022, we recorded revenue of $92.6 million with a net income attributable to common stockholders
of $9.7 million. FFO and AFFO for the third quarter were $48.2 million and $41.3 million, respectively, or $0.46 and $0.40 per share. On a
constant currency basis, applying the average monthly currency rates from the second quarter 2022, revenues would have been up by
$1.2 million to $93.8 million. Using the same constant currency concept year-over-year, revenues would have been up by $4.9 million to
$97.5 million.
Core FFO grew by 9.6% year-over-year to $48.3 million or $0.47 per share and AFFO was $41.3 million or $0.40 per share. Our AFFO was
impacted by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro and pound. However, our comprehensive hedging program helped
reduce the impact of the ongoing turbulence in these currencies. As always, a reconciliation of GAAP net income to the non-GAAP
measures can be found in our earnings release.
On the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with net debt of $2.2 billion at a weighted average interest rate of 3.5% and $128 million of
cash and cash equivalents. Our net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA ratio was 8x at the end of the quarter. The weighted
average debt maturity at the end of the third quarter 2022 was 4.2 years. The components of our debt include $500 million in senior
notes, $605.1 million on the multicurrency revolving credit facility and $1.3 billion of outstanding gross mortgage debt. This debt was
approximately 75% fixed rate, which is inclusive of floating rate debt with in-place interest rate swaps. The company has a
well-cushioned interest coverage ratio of 3.3x.
As of September 30, 2022, liquidity was approximately $206.9 million. The company distributed $41.7 million in dividends to common
shareholders in the quarter or $0.40 per share. Our net debt to enterprise value was 62.3% with an enterprise value of $3.6 billion based
on the September 30, 2022 closing share price of $10.65 for common shares, $21.58 for Series A preferred shares and $22.20 for Series B
preferred shares.
With that, I'll turn the call back to Jim for some closing remarks.
 
James Larry Nelson
Global Net Lease, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Thanks, Chris. I'm very pleased with our progress and accomplishments during the third quarter, including our ongoing successful
leasing activity and the forward pipeline of accretive acquisitions we have built in the current market of expanding cap rates. Our
best-in-class portfolio features long-term leases with investment-grade and other high-quality tenants, balanced asset classes and
strong geographic and industry diversity.
Our primarily fixed rate debt and comprehensive hedging strategies have helped to minimize the impact of recent interest rate and
foreign exchange turbulence, allowing us to focus on creating value for shareholders. We believe we are well positioned to continue to
enhance our portfolio and grow earnings for shareholders throughout the balance of 2022 and into next year.
With that, operator, we can open the line for questions.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 
Operator
(Operator Instructions) And our first question is from the line of Bryan Maher with B. Riley Securities.
 
Bryan Anthony Maher
B. Riley Securities, Inc., Research Division - MD
A couple of quick questions on the foreign currency front. I know that you guys gave the impact on revenues, but maybe a two-part
question. I don't know, Chris, if you have it, but what was the impact on AFFO per share? And I realize that you guys had some gains from
the hedging activity. So that's kind of part one. Part two is, have you considered or would you consider doing more hedges? And how
costly is that?
 
Christopher J. Masterson
Global Net Lease, Inc. - CFO, Treasurer & Secretary
Sure. So I guess the first part to start with, in terms of the impact on AFFO, we did quarter-over-quarter, have about $2.6 million or $2.7
million of decrease related to primarily FX. There was about $0.5 million related to some OpEx on a vacant tenant, but that was mostly
driven by -- of the FX. And then in terms of the actual hedges, the realized gains that we recorded for the quarter were $2.4 million. Last
quarter, we actually had $1.5 million in realized gains. So we're up almost $1 million quarter-over-quarter in the realized gains.
In terms of the increasing in the hedging going forward, I mean, we have had a pretty consistent strategy for hedging. And what we do is
we focus on hedging the net cash flows because that is actual foreign currency that we will be bringing in the door and need to convert.
So we won't necessarily go beyond our cash flows because that's moving us out of our strategy of trying to minimize risk, but we have
been consistently evaluating if we did want to increase some of the percentage that we do hedge compared to the exposure.
And in terms of cost, there's really very little cost to these hedges. We don't have to put any cash out the door on day 1. Effectively, in
terms of the forward contracts, we are locking in spot rates in the future that will be converting the cash back into USD. And like I said, no
additional cash going out the doors first.
 
Bryan Anthony Maher
B. Riley Securities, Inc., Research Division - MD
Okay. And then on the disposition front, I know you gave us the metrics on that, but maybe a little bit more color, again, kind of two
parts. Is the goal to kind of divest of noncore assets and recycle that into better performing assets and/or is it to deleverage or maybe
both? And I think you said you're 8x net debt to EBITDA. What is the goal?
 
James Larry Nelson
Global Net Lease, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
First of all, we will divest ourselves of properties when we deem it's appropriate. As you know, we divested a big property in Germany a
few years ago, where we knew the tenant was moving out, and we had 3 unsolicited offers on the property, and we made a good profit on
it. We are divesting ourselves of a few other things. We will continue to divest noncore assets, which is primarily the retail assets, which,
over time, we are definitely sellers of retail.
As far as the rest of the portfolio goes, and in general, all the portfolio is performing extremely well. So we don't sell properties because
they're not performing. We may sell a property if there are other reasons behind it, for example, if a tenant is moving out, and we think
it's better to sell the property and repurpose the funds into a new -- into buying new assets. But there are a lot of different factors for us
to decide what to divest of. And we will continue to follow that sort of program as we move ahead. What was the other part of your
question, Bryan? Say it again.
 
Bryan Anthony Maher
B. Riley Securities, Inc., Research Division - MD
The leverage level, I think you're at 8x now. Is there a goal to be meaningfully lower than that? Or are you fine at 8x?
 
James Larry Nelson
Global Net Lease, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
No. Ultimately, we would like to be down into the low to the mid-6s. But with the stock price where it is, I mean, the easiest way to
delever would be -- if the stock price was at a decent level, would be to sell some stock on the ATM and use that to delever. So we always
have a goal of getting down into the low 6s. Right now with where the economy is with inflation, potential recession, we're just sticking to
our guns here and being very cautious about how we deploy capital and where we're going forward. We do have a strong balance sheet.
We do have some attractive acquisitions, potential acquisitions in the pipeline, but we're being very cautious.
 
Bryan Anthony Maher
B. Riley Securities, Inc., Research Division - MD
Great. And just last for me. On the lease renewals, renewals or new leases, how is that dialogue progressing these days? I mean has the
tone changed at all? Is there any pushback from the rate increases that you're looking to get? And is there any thought to increasing rent
escalators, given the current state of inflation? And that's all for me.
 
James Larry Nelson
Global Net Lease, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Well, thanks, Bryan. In our new leases, we're looking at anywhere from a floor to 2% to 4% and a much higher upside. So on all new
leases, we're building in much, much larger escalators. When we renew leases, we're doing the same thing, and we have not had any
pushback from our tenants on any of this so far. I think we're very fortunate because of the high quality of our portfolio and the locations
of our properties that really give us an advantage in dealing with our tenants on renewals, and looking forward as far as getting them to
stay for long periods of time. But thank you, Bryan. I appreciate the call.
 
Operator
Our next question is from the line of James Allen Villard with Ladenburg Thalmann.
 
James Villard
Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst
I guess, just kind of big picture, are you seeing any impact in terms of tenant credit health kind of in your European portfolio from kind of
the energy cost inflation? And how are you all thinking about that moving forward?
 
James Larry Nelson
Global Net Lease, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Well, you have to remember that a large majority of our tenants are investment grade. And we have a committee that watches our
tenants' credit, and we have no one on the watch list right now. Our European tenants, Whirlpool, Johnson Controls, ING, they're all in
good shape, and they pay their rents on time. So we really don't have a concern as far as collecting rents. I mean energy basically hurts
everyone as we see this inflation. But I think we're very fortunate with the high quality of the tenants in our portfolio, and we will probably
be affected less than a lot of other people, so.
 
James Villard
Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division - Research Analyst
Yes. And I guess how is that affecting, I guess, future acquisitions in Europe?
 
James Larry Nelson
Global Net Lease, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Well, we're being very cautious. As I said earlier, we're looking for higher cap rates, which we're starting to see, and we are seeing a
bunch of stuff that are in the pipeline right now. We've been very cautious, as I said, for the whole year as far as deploying capital
because there's a lot of unknowns out there in the economy today. But we're seeing stuff that we like at decent prices.
 
Operator
Our next question is from the line of Mitch Germain with JMP Securities.
 
Mitchell Bradley Germain
JMP Securities LLC, Research Division - MD & Equity Research Analyst
Can I get a little more detail on the asset sales? I guess one completed, right, and then two additional. And I think you gave the amount
was 110. Do you have like a breakdown of -- and I might have missed it in what you provided earlier today, but do you have a breakdown
of what was sold versus what's for sale?
 
James Larry Nelson
Global Net Lease, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Chris, can you handle that?
 
Christopher J. Masterson
Global Net Lease, Inc. - CFO, Treasurer & Secretary
Sure, absolutely. So the property that was sold during the quarter was actually a small property. That was roughly about $3 million. The
property that we expect to close on the sale in the fourth quarter, that property is approximately $48 million, that's a property in France.
And then there is one additional property, which is vacant, that sale price is a little over $60 million and that we expect to close next year.
 
James Larry Nelson
Global Net Lease, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
And Mitch to give you a little color. The building in France is a large office building, so that will reduce our office exposure.
 
Mitchell Bradley Germain
JMP Securities LLC, Research Division - MD & Equity Research Analyst
Great. But you're buying office?
 
James Larry Nelson
Global Net Lease, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
We're buying one small office building, a government office building in Belgium, I think.
 
Mitchell Bradley Germain
JMP Securities LLC, Research Division - MD & Equity Research Analyst
Government lease, okay, good.
 
James Larry Nelson
Global Net Lease, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Government lease, long-term lease, great credit.
 
Mitchell Bradley Germain
JMP Securities LLC, Research Division - MD & Equity Research Analyst
Okay. Makes sense. You've got some debt coming due next year. What is the plan -- $231 million, what's the plan for that?
 
Christopher J. Masterson
Global Net Lease, Inc. - CFO, Treasurer & Secretary
So that debt is our U.K. debt. We are currently evaluating our options, but we do have the ability to refinance that using our credit facility
and pull those properties onto the credit line as an option.
 
James Larry Nelson
Global Net Lease, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
So Mitch, that's a decision we don't have to make today because it's not coming due until the middle of next year. But we watch the
markets pretty closely. And obviously, we will try to find the best pricing on the debt to benefit our shareholders as best we can. So it's a
decision we'll make a little closer to the due date, but we are watching it very, very carefully.
 
Mitchell Bradley Germain
JMP Securities LLC, Research Division - MD & Equity Research Analyst
And I know you have a multicurrency credit facility, and I noticed there wasn't much of a change in the average price
quarter-over-quarter. But I suspect because of your European exposure there, the likelihood is that rate has jumped pretty dramatically
at this point. Is that a good way to think about it? Or is there some hedging there that I'm not aware of?
 
Christopher J. Masterson
Global Net Lease, Inc. - CFO, Treasurer & Secretary
There is hedging there. And that's part of the reason why you're seeing some of the rates stay pretty consistent because we do have --
and we have extended some of the hedging out further.
 
Mitchell Bradley Germain
JMP Securities LLC, Research Division - MD & Equity Research Analyst
Just -- I'm sure you have it somewhere, and I probably just read it, but how much of your debt is pure variable, no hedge?
 
Christopher J. Masterson
Global Net Lease, Inc. - CFO, Treasurer & Secretary
I'm just pulling that up. I believe it's about 25% is the number.
 
Mitchell Bradley Germain
JMP Securities LLC, Research Division - MD & Equity Research Analyst
Okay. That's consistent with what I saw then. Okay. Right. Makes sense. And Chris, help me out here. Just one more question. I guess just
understanding some of your language around FX, was it a headwind towards the bottom line or was it a tailwind?
 
Christopher J. Masterson
Global Net Lease, Inc. - CFO, Treasurer & Secretary
A headwind. So I pulled down the actual, say, revenue numbers because, obviously, as the euro and the pound weakened, their
conversion to USD was lower than it would a previously would have been.
 
Operator
At this time, I will turn the floor back to Mr. Nelson for closing remarks.
 
James Larry Nelson
Global Net Lease, Inc. - President, CEO & Director
Well, I want to thank everybody for joining us on today's call. This company is operating very solidly. We're very pleased with the gains
we've made on leasing and in maintaining a strong balance sheet. The company, we have a great portfolio, we have great tenants, and
we're actually very proud of the portfolio we've built over the last number of years.
So thank you very much for calling in today and listening in, and we will talk to you next quarter. Thanks, everybody. Bye-bye.
