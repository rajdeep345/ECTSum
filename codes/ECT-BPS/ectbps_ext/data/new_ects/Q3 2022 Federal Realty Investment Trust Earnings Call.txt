Hello, and welcome to the Federal Realty Investment Trust Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Please
note this event is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Leah Brady. Please go ahead.
 
Leah Andress Brady
Federal Realty Investment Trust - VP of IR
Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us today for Federal Realty's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on the call

And with that, I will turn the call over to Don Wood to begin our discussion of our third quarter results. Don?
 
Donald C. Wood
Federal Realty Investment Trust - CEO & Director
Well, thanks, Leah, and hello, everyone. Well, consumer spending remains very strong in the major submarkets where Federal operates,
particularly in our mixed-use properties, and has resulted in another quarter of outperformance in terms of both executing long-term
leases as well as bottom line earnings. 126 executed long-term leases for 585,000 square feet of space and FFO per share of $1.59 were
both above external and internal expectations and continue to signal strong demand for high-quality retail and mixed-use real estate.
The future pipeline of deals not yet executed also remains robust, and as such, we'll be raising 2022 guidance again.
Demographics matter, especially in times of economic uncertainty. Past cycles have convinced us that families simply have to have
money to spend for retail real estate cash flow to grow. 68,000 households with annual average household incomes of $150,000 sit
within 3 miles of Federal Realty Centers. That's $10.2 billion of family income generated within a 3-mile radius, and more than half of
those people have a 4-year college degree or better. I know of no other significantly sized retail portfolio that can say that.
It's manifesting itself in a myriad of ways, including a wide variety of tenants who are seeing their sales exceed the over-trend threshold
in the lease. And while not a huge absolute number, since we strive for strong fixed rent in our leases, the broad-based over-trend
contribution in the quarter, particularly among our restaurants and soft goods tenants, over and above the fixed rent is notable and
contributed an additional $0.02 per share compared with last year's third quarter.
As I said, strong core leasing remains the engine that drives us. Over the last decade, pre-COVID, that's 2010 through 2019, average third
quarter production for comparable properties at Federal meant doing 88 deals or just over 400,000 square feet. In the 2022 third
quarter, we did 119 deals for 563,000 square feet, 40% more than the average.
Annual rent bumps of our retail leases averaged about 2.25% overall and higher when including office leases. That's a powerful
advantage over the typical shopping center portfolio.
The fact that demand has remained this heated with a deal pipeline that looks to stay strong, speaks volume and better properties and
the markets they're in and naturally, about future property level operating income growth. It's one of the reasons Dan is again raising
annual earnings guidance $0.12 at the midpoint.
The solid tenant performance also manifests itself in continued occupancy gains as tenant failures remain low. Our current year lease
rate is now at 94.3% and occupied rate now at 92.1%. Those leased and occupied rates are 150 and 190 basis points, respectively, better
than a year ago, and there's obviously still room to grow there, particularly on the small shop side. At 89.9% leased, small shop space is
a remarkable 640 basis points higher than the COVID low point, with further gains expected by year-end.
I referred earlier to the outsized demand that we see at our mixed-use properties. Note that the retail component of our four large ones,
Assembly, Pike & Rose, Bethesda and Santana, are 98% leased at quarter's end. In addition, we continue overall to hit or beat targeted
delivery dates, one of our key corporate goals for 2022 and a real tribute to our tenant coordination and construction teams.
I'm as convinced as I've ever been that we have the right product in the right locations with the right demographics for the inflationary
economy that we're in. And by the way, with a well-demonstrated 55-year respect for the dividend component of our total return, a
dividend yield of 4.3% for a portfolio of this quality seems awfully compelling to us.
And against that backdrop, we've also been able to sell a couple of noncore assets at good pricing and refinance and upsize our term
loan and line of credit to be sure that we have plenty of balance sheet flexibility and dry powder for whatever the economic environment
feels like in 2023.
In terms of capital needed for our large development projects, we have less than an incremental $225 million to go. About $100 million
to complete the Choice Hotel Headquarters building at Pike & Rose; $100 million largely for 10 build-out commissions at Santana West;
and $20 million to complete Darian Commons. By the way, after the quarter, just last week, we just signed a 52,000 square foot lease
with a credit tenant bringing that building at Pike & Rose to over 60% pre-leased.
Those projects alone will be contributing an incremental $40 million in operating income in years to come. Investing in these and other
projects, both large and small, with fixed-rate debt and equity before the recent rise in rates will serve us well in the coming years as
these state-of-the-art buildings begin cash flowing.
Similar to development, our pro rata share of the acquisitions that we've made since the beginning of COVID through today totaled $850
million. Those acquisitions from Grossmont to Camelback Colonnade, to Pembroke Gardens and so forth are performing well ahead of
our expectations in the aggregate and are expected to yield in the mid-6s in 2023.
In that same time period, we generated over $400 million in proceeds from noncore asset sales at a sub-5 cap. That capital recycling was
not only immediately accretive, but the medium- and long-term growth rates of our acquisitions, net of dispositions, are clearly superior.
Okay. That's about it for my prepared remarks this morning, though, I'd like to leave you with one final thought before turning it over to
Dan. In our view, the recent run-up in interest rates was inevitable, but not necessarily at the pace we're seeing. While sure to pressure
everybody's earnings to some extent in the years ahead, how much so and for how long remains to be seen. So the real question is, will
property level operating income more than compensate? These are the times when well-leased, well-located dominant retail and
mixed-use centers in supply-constrained affluent, densely populated markets and submarkets shine.
We're in a cyclical business, no news to anyone. And it's why our business plan has always included multiple ways to counter the rise in
money costs and the effects of inflation. The combination of best-in-class shopping centers along with acquisition and development
property level income contributions financed with money from an earlier time, along with the potential sale of certain assets, including
discrete residential buildings within our portfolio, gives us more flexibility and more tools with which to handle cyclical pressures than
most.
We look forward to the challenge. Dan?
 
Daniel Guglielmone
Federal Realty Investment Trust - Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer
Thank you, Don, and hello, everyone. For another quarter, strength and resilience of our portfolio has exceeded expectations. With FFO
per share of $1.59, we beat a strong comparable from third quarter of 2021 by over 5% and beat consensus by $0.06.
And once again, we saw broad strength across all aspects of our business driving this performance. Continued gains in small shop
occupancy; strong tenant sales driving higher percentage rent; continued increases in customer traffic resulting in another uptick in
parking revenues; strength in our residential assets; and better collections than forecast, although offset by higher property level
expenses and higher interest.
Let me add some color to these items. Small shop-leased occupancy basically hit 90%, up 60 basis points over 2Q, up 380 basis points
year-over-year and up to a level not achieved since 2017, but still not back to targeted levels.
Parking revenues, a strong indicator of consumer traffic at our mixed-use assets, continued higher, up 8% sequentially over 2Q and 33%
year-over-year.
Percentage rent, an indicator of tenant sales strength, was up over 31% sequentially and almost double third quarter 2021's level.
Same-store residential POI was up over 10% year-over-year.
On the other side, we did start to see some inflationary impact in operating expenses in the quarter as OpEx grew by 10% over 3Q 2021.
However, we estimate that roughly 1/3 of that increase is nonrecurring and it is all predominantly recoverable from tenants.
Despite coming off a strong comp in '21, our comparable growth metric for 3Q was a solid 3.7%, well above forecast. Comparable growth,
excluding prior period rent and term fees, was 6.3%. On a cash basis, our same-store metric is 5%. Excluding prior period rent and term
fees, our same-store metric is up to 8%. Year-to-date, comparable POI growth is a sector-leading 8.8% and almost 10% on a cash-based
same-store metric.
For those of you that track it, term fees this quarter were $1.3 million, up from $0.5 million in '21, but down significantly from the second
quarter's $5.6 million. Prior period rent was $2 million, decreasing $4 million relative to the third quarter's $6 million level. Again, this is
adjusted to reflect only negotiated prior period rent payments relating to COVID-19.
We had another exceptional quarter of leasing, a record for any third quarter, giving us 9 consecutive quarters of above-average leasing
activity and not by a little bit, by over 25% on average over this 9 quarter period and 40% this quarter. Furthermore, our pipeline remains
as robust as we've seen it, currently exceeding both second quarter of 2022, third quarter of 2021 levels at this juncture in the quarter.
Our rent rollover metric was 3% for the quarter, with rollover gains for deals in our pipeline, indicating a much more robust outlook in
future quarters. We also had another solid quarter achieving sector-leading rent bumps as we continue to drive average annual
contractual increases of 2.25% for retail leases only, full banker and small shop blended. And as a result, our rollover on a straight-line
basis is 13%.
And I know I'm repeating myself, but for every 100 basis points higher in annual rent bumps, the ending rent will be 9% to 10% higher at
the end of a 10-year lease. Hence, a portfolio with 2.25% rent bumps and 3% rollover is the equivalent of a portfolio with only 1.25% rent
bumps and 12% rollover. Plus the 2.25% rent bump portfolio collects more along the way.
With respect to our balance sheet, we made significant progress during the quarter in enhancing our liquidity and financial flexibility.
Just after quarter end, we closed on a comprehensive refinancing which increased our unsecured bank capacity by over $0.5 billion from
$1.3 billion previously to $1.85 billion today and a combined revolving credit facility and term loan, both of which we expanded.
We increased our previous $1 billion revolving credit facility to $1.25 billion, extending the term to April of 2027 with 2 6-month options
out to 2028. And transitioned the base rate from LIBOR to SOFR, and we doubled the size of our existing term loan from $300 million to
$600 million. This term loan has an April 2024 maturity with 2 additional 1-year extension options, which take us out to 2026 at our
option.
The interest rate here also transition from LIBOR to SOFR. As a result, at closing of the facilities, we had $1.4 billion of total liquidity,
including the $1.25 billion available on our undrawn credit facility.
With respect to leverage metrics at quarter end, our net-debt-EBITDA ratio is roughly 6x annualized for the quarter and adjusted for
asset activity, comfortably within the range of our ratings and we continue to target a ratio in the low to mid-5x over time.
Our fixed charge coverage ratio rests at 4x. And additionally, we sold 2 assets, 1 retail center and 1 residential asset, during the quarter
for a total of $67 million at a blended 5.25% cap rate.
And we're in process on an additional asset -- on additional asset sales totaling over $350 million in potential proceeds at a blended cap
rate that is sub-5%. Having noncore assets, including residential that we can sell at extremely attractive valuations even in this
environment is an arrow in our quiver that most retail companies do not have.
On to the remainder of 2022. Given another quarter of outperformance and a strong outlook for 4Q, we are increasing our guidance from
$6.10 to $6.25 to a tightened range of $6.27 to $6.32 per share, an increase of $0.12 at the midpoint or 2%. And this is on top of 2 other
guidance increases earlier this year in the first half, which bring our year-to-date total increases in guidance to $0.45.
Current 2022 guidance implies 13% growth over '21 at the midpoint despite over 200 basis points of headwinds from prior period rent.
We are also bumping up our forecast for comparable POI growth to 7% to 8% from the prior range of 5.5% to 7%. Excluding prior period
rents and term fees, our comparable POI forecast increases to 9% to 10% from the prior range of 7.5% to 9%. We continue to expect our
occupied rate decline from 92.1% today, up to around 92.5% by year-end. And please note that our recent third quarter acquisitions
weighed on our occupancy growth during the quarter.
This guidance assumes a range of $1.53 to $1.58 of FFO per share for the fourth quarter.
With respect to 2023, we will be giving formal guidance on our call in February, but let me provide some commentary for you to consider.
Our $600 million term loan is floating rate. We have consciously decided not to hedge the rate to maximize our financial flexibility to be
opportunistic in the timing of refinancing on a longer-term fixed rate basis. Its interest rate is set at term SOFR as adjusted plus an 85
basis point spread, which is 4.7% today. Also note, while our only debt maturity in 2023 is $275 million of unsecured notes with the June
maturity, it does have a 2.75% interest rate. We again expect prior period rents and term fees not to contribute from 2023 to the level
they did this year, although the impact will not be as material as it was this year.
And G&A, which is running at $13 million per quarter currently, is expected to increase in 2023 using -- use $14 million per quarter as a
good placeholder for now.
As a counter to these trends, our core business continues to show significant strength. Given over 2 years of above-average leasing
volumes with relatively little impact from failing retailers over the last year, we expect to see POI in 2023 continue to show strong
momentum, driven by solid comparable growth continuing in 2023 in the existing portfolio, driven by 220 basis points of signed, not
occupied upside and a robust current portfolio of new leasing as well as growth in the noncomparable portfolio, particularly at the
recently stabilized Assembly Row Phase III, a 100% leased 909 Rose at Pike & Rose and the 100% leased CocoWalk.
Despite uncertainty in the economic outlook for 2023, POI growth will be robust and should provide momentum to counter inflationary
pressures and higher interest rates.
And with that, operator, you can open up the line for questions.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 
Operator
(Operator Instructions) The first question today comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.
 
Alexander David Goldfarb
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst
So Dan, I just want to go back to the rent spreads because this is something you guys have talked about over time and certainly, looking
at your spreads in the quarter, they're not -- they're low, but the FFO growth is high. And we would rather have FFO growth than rent
spreads. So can you just sort of give an overview of how we should think about the interaction between rent spreads and FFO? And then I
think you said that your -- every year, the embedded annual bumps are 2.5%. But one, I just want to validate that number; and two, is
that just small shop? Or is that also in like the junior anchors and some of the bigger format retailers?
 
Daniel Guglielmone
Federal Realty Investment Trust - Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer
Yes. No, we'll go to rent spreads FFO first. Yes, the rent spreads we announced are for deals that are signed during the quarter. They will
not start for the next year or 2. So there's obviously -- and that's just 1 component of how our company grows, which is what the rent
spreads are. As we said, we also grow rents from contractual rent bumps, which we'll get -- we'll hit here. It is 2.25%, retail leases only,
both anchor and small shop blended that we see in our portfolio, a little bit higher if you include the office leases where we get a little bit
higher bumps.
 
Alexander David Goldfarb
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst
And the second question goes back to the guidance that you gave a few quarters ago on '23 and '24. Obviously, this year has really
outperformed. And it's hard to believe that the metrics for '23 and '24 sort of stuck in the ground and that this year has come up, but it's
just going to flatten growth. So is that really the case? Like we should think about it flattening growth versus the goalposts that you guys
laid out a few quarters ago? Or can we think about '23 and '24, those goalposts moving up as well?
 
Daniel Guglielmone
Federal Realty Investment Trust - Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer
Look, we provided goalposts or guideposts that got us to 2023, and we've hit that here in 2022. We're going to provide guidance in 2023
on our February call. But one thing I will tell you is we will see really, really good and strong, robust property operating income at the
property level in 2023. And we'll continue to see growth coming from our noncomparable portfolio coming online as well contributing.
And that's obviously, in this environment, we'll have to counter inflation on operating expenses, and we'll look to counter the impact of
interest expense.
 
Donald C. Wood
Federal Realty Investment Trust - CEO & Director
And I would just add, Alex, to the implication of your question, which I understand and let me just say, there are 2 things. When we gave
that -- those goalposts back there, it was obviously based on the timing of the recovery. As you said, the timing of the recovery has clearly
been faster, and that's great news.
But also, to your point, not only the timing of the recovery, it's been the strength of the recovery. So I would expect that POI growth on the
property level to be even more robust than when we set those guideposts back in whenever we set them in '21 or '20, effectively. So at the
POI level, you're darn right. This business is performing as good or better than it ever has. And a lot of that's post-COVID.
Obviously, we got to deal with the current macroeconomic situation in terms of interest rates and all. But overall, your point is a good
one, that not only did we get there faster, we got there in '22 versus '23, but if you were to reset today and look at those POI goals, that
those goals are effectively even better with respect to the core portfolio because of the strength in the leasing over this period of time.
 
Operator
The next question comes from Craig Schmidt with Bank of America.
 
Craig Richard Schmidt
BofA Securities, Research Division - Director
We have definitely witnessed your properties and your traders perform well in an inflationary environment. I'm wondering. How do you
think it might perform in a recessionary environment?
 
Donald C. Wood
Federal Realty Investment Trust - CEO & Director
Well, yes. I don't think there's a lot of wondering about that. If you take a look at history, obviously, this isn't the same as the Great
Financial Crisis. It's not the same as the dot-com crisis of 2000, 2002, Craig. But it is clearly a period or going into a period of reduced
economic activity, call it what you will. It's why we own the properties we own. It's why the demographics, we believe, are incredibly
important going forward.
So what those exact numbers will be and what their -- what the future holds in terms of both inflation and reduced economic activity, I
firmly believe we'll outperform. And I believe that just as we have in past cycles because the affluence, the density and the barriers to
entry of where we are. I go back to those numbers because they're so important. When you've got $10 billion of income power within 3
miles of a shopping center, it's very hard to imagine that that's not going to be a significant advantage in both an inflationary
environment and a lower economic activity environment. So I like this on a relative basis very much.
 
Craig Richard Schmidt
BofA Securities, Research Division - Director
And I agree with you that they're definitely a tale of 2 cities when you look at different income cohorts and how they're spending. But I'm
wondering if your centers have also benefited from what we're seeing as people are more actively pursuing experiences. Travel, it's held
up well; people paying very high rates for vacation in hotels. And just frankly, the socialization and experience at your shopping centers
may also be benefiting from just the consumers wanting to get back to that aspect of their life.
 
Donald C. Wood
Federal Realty Investment Trust - CEO & Director
Craig, it's hard to imagine that's not the case. We're taking this goal today from Santana Row out in the middle of Silicon Valley. There's
always confusion as Silicon Valley, the Bay Area and the stuff that you hear about San Francisco. It couldn't be -- 40 miles is 1,000 miles
away in terms of markets. I'm looking out on this street right here. If you saw the activity, if you saw the restaurant numbers, in particular,
that are generated here, it goes to validate your point critically.
We're seeing the same type of thing in those restaurant numbers at Assembly Row and at Pike & Rose. And so the notion of the
combination of those type of properties, along with a very substantial grocery-anchored shopping center portfolio together, I think,
makes your point, crystal clear.
 
Operator
The next question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore.
 
Stephen Thomas Sakwa
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD & Senior Equity Research Analyst
I guess, Dan or Don or Wendy, just as you talk about the leasing pipeline, I was just wondering if you could add a little bit of color on the
types of tenants that you're seeing, if there's any regional variation? And I guess, as you think about the upside in the portfolio, where do
you think the lease percentage can ultimately get back to? And when does the -- I guess, the gap between leased and occupied close
more significantly?
 
Wendy A. Seher
Federal Realty Investment Trust - Executive VP & Eastern Region President
I guess, Steve, I'll take the first part of that question. And as you've heard in our remarks, the pipeline that I'm seeing is really strong.
What we've just accomplished in the quarter and, frankly, the last 12 months by taking our small shop and increasing it by 380 basis
points over a 12-month period is remarkable. I'm proud of the team, of course, and just speaks to the real estate.
As I look at what we've been doing, I mean, we've had everything from Athleta, to Nike, to DAVE's HOT CHICKEN seems to be the big
one, to Petco, to very broad-based as it has been, frankly, in the last several quarters, so again, seeing it.
And the other piece of this that is really positive is the activity that we're seeing and the challenges that we're having, both on the retail
side and on the landlord side, is cost of construction with the relationships that we have and the amount of tenants that we're dealing
with over a period of time and the credibility that we have in the market to do what we say we're going to do.
We've kind of have been able to put our heads together and figure out how to move forward on a lease, even though some costs can be
challenging. And with this transparent approach, we've not only been able to get the rents that we need to have it make economic sense,
but we've been able to grow the annual embedded increases in the leases that makes sense for us. So again, speaks to the strength of
the real estate and that buying power within those markets.
 
Donald C. Wood
Federal Realty Investment Trust - CEO & Director
And I guess, Steve, with respect to the second part of your question, I would very much expect this portfolio to be a 95%-plus leased
portfolio. Now the notion of the timing of getting there is dependent on a number of things. First of all, we're not solely driven by
occupancy. We're driven by economics and value creation. And I'll give you a perfect example. What happens with the Bed Bath &
Beyonds as we go forward? If I had my way, we'd get them back as soon as we can, and we'd lease them to more productive tenants at
higher rents. That's what we'd like to be able to do.
Now that will -- that doesn't mean we won't extend one for a year or another year or whatever. But I guess occupancy per se, my point is
here, is only one consideration in trying to reach a goal. It's not trying to get to 95%, no matter who and no matter what. That's an
important thing to understand. And I do think that's something that we take -- we put a lot of weight on the balance necessary to be able
to get there.
The second thing is, obviously, the leaks in the bottom of the bucket. What are we going to see over the next couple of years in terms of
tenant failures, et cetera? Obviously, we've gone into this period of time post-COVID in a better position, the industry has because of the
loss of weak tenants at the beginning of COVID. And at this point, it's still looking really strong, and I don't see a lot of leases at the
bottom of the bucket beyond the Bed Baths and always a few small shops [and so on]. But how -- what the extent that's going to be is
going to determine the timing of what -- of the question that you're asking. I would hope to be there within a couple of years.
 
Jeffrey S. Berkes
Federal Realty Investment Trust - President & COO
Steve, it's Jeff. Just bat and clean up here. We've probably got another 100 basis points to go to get to where we want to be on our
signed, nonoccupied percentage. We're sitting at 220 basis points today, and historically, that's been 100 to 125 basis points. And like
Wendy said, we are doing everything we can, working our relationships with not only the tenants, but also the people that do the work
both inside the company and outside the company to build out space as fast as possible. They get rents started. That's really been going
now for us for the last 6, 8 quarters, and we hope to get that shrunk down in short order. Exactly when it will happen, like Don just said,
we can't call yet, but that is a primary objective there.
 
Daniel Guglielmone
Federal Realty Investment Trust - Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer
Yes. We've made good progress on that. It used to be north of 300 basis point spread. We've got it down to 200 on our way to that
targeted 100 to 125 basis points.
 
Jeffrey S. Berkes
Federal Realty Investment Trust - President & COO
And I guess the fourth matter really is the clean-up matter.
 
Stephen Thomas Sakwa
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD & Senior Equity Research Analyst
Sorry for the long question. Second, just on capital deployment. I guess, Don, how are you thinking or how have you changed kind of your
hurdles for either new development, redevelopments ground up or acquisitions? It sounds like you have a pretty robust disposition
pipeline at 5%. But just how are you thinking about unlevered yields for new investments?
 
Donald C. Wood
Federal Realty Investment Trust - CEO & Director
Yes. Well, obviously, that's all in that state of flux as the capital markets are in that state of flux. So within the context of that, Steve, the
bottom line is we're still -- we always, through periods, want to make sure that the company continues to view capital on the long-term
weighted average cost basis, not just yield for a particular project at any one time because it's as uncertain in terms of where it's going to
end up at this point. We have clearly put the brakes on some of that capital deployment for new projects unless the project we're working
on is very clearly not only needed for the asset, but very accretive. And that puts it up in those 8%, 9%, 10% ranges to be able to do right
now.
That won't stay like that forever. We just want more visibility in terms of where that overall cost of capital will end up. And I think you
would probably agree somewhere by the middle of next year, we'll have an awful lot more visibility than we do today.
 
Operator
The next question comes from Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank.
 
Derek Charles Johnston
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Research Analyst
We view renewed office demand as a real potential positive catalyst for Federal and especially when it comes to investor sentiment. And I
think I'd say what we learned exiting the pandemic era is office location, newness, quality operators, they've all seen and should continue
to see outsized demand.
So I guess how are tours progressing and interest progressing specifically at Santana West and perhaps touch on some other assets?
And are you more confident on your office component, given what you're seeing on the ground than maybe a few quarters ago or a year
ago?
 
Donald C. Wood
Federal Realty Investment Trust - CEO & Director
Derek, it's a great question. I really appreciate that. Let me start by saying and I've said it a million times, but I couldn't believe it more,
all office is not created equal. The notion of having the type of office product that we do, which is solely at our big mixed-use
development, so therefore, solely driven by the retail environment effectively, that is the differentiator here along with new buildings.
If there's any demand for office space, how can that not be -- knowing the economy, knowing the proclivities of CEOs and hiring
managers, et cetera, how can that not be the best product available? We remain as confident as we've ever been. As I said, we just signed
a lease. I can't disclose who it is at this point until they tell their employees, et cetera, over at the 9/15 meeting at Pike & Rose.
In terms of Santana West, we're not there on anybody yet, but we remain as positive as we ever have with respect to the product. The
reason I'm out here at Santana Row and why we held our Board meeting out here over the last couple of days, was to make sure our
Board saw what we see in terms of the product that we are delivering here and heard from Jeff, who you'll hear from here in a second, in
terms of this environment. You've got to be bullish about this over the middle term.
 
Jeffrey S. Berkes
Federal Realty Investment Trust - President & COO
Yes. I mean setting 9/15 in 1 Santana was the site. Our office portfolio is 97%, 98% leased. And the reason why it is, is because all of our
office locations are amenitized and we've been saying this for a long time, that is the new standard for having office space. If you can't
offer your employees amenities, you can't keep your buildings leased and we have amenities in spades at our properties, and that's why
we're 97%, 98% leased.
Big change out here in Silicon Valley. We talked a little bit about this last quarter. But 3, 6 months ago, the big question here was, when
are we going to get people back to the office? And I think I said on last quarter's call that Apple, Google and others had made the
decision to get people back right after Labor Day. And that has, in fact, happened. If you live or work out here, you'd notice that when you
turn on the TV in the morning and see the traffic stacked up to get over the Bay Bridge or you drive down 280 past Apple's headquarters,
there's a line of people to get off 280 at the Apple headquarters' exit. So the conversation has changed from when to what.
And the what is all about what do we need in the way of space to rightsize our requirement and provide our employees what they're
demanding, which is state-of-the-art space with state-of-the-art systems and amenities.
So the confidence that Don just mentioned is because of that. And if you look around Silicon Valley, there's really only 1 building that's
state-of-the-art with state-of-the-art amenities and that's 1 Santana West. So I wish we could say when. We can't. But we remain positive
on our prospects to lease that building.
 
Derek Charles Johnston
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Research Analyst
All right. We will stay tuned. And I guess, secondly, you mentioned Bed Bath & Beyond. Can you talk about the watch list? And
specifically for your portfolio, right? And how your centers and tenant exposures may differ from peers, so that it's well understood out
there?
 
Daniel Guglielmone
Federal Realty Investment Trust - Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer
Thanks, Derek. Yes. No, look, with the exception of Bed Bath & Beyond, that's probably at the top of our list, we only have about 83 basis
points of exposure to them. About 60 basis points of that is to the Bed Bath name. Other than them, nobody else is anywhere close to
material in terms of folks we're focused on. They're all single-digit basis points of revenue. And so there's really not anything that's on a
near-term concern list for us.
Wendy, anything to add?
 
Wendy A. Seher
Federal Realty Investment Trust - Executive VP & Eastern Region President
I would say, when I think about Bed Bath & Beyond, look at what we've done over the last 3, 4 years or so, which is we've kind of reduced
our exposure in that -- with them as a company at probably about 4 or 5 locations. So material.
And as I look at what's left, we have 3 buybuy BABYs that are in good healthy condition in terms of their productivity from the shopping
centers, and we have 6 Bed Bath & Beyond and 1 Harman. And as -- I could agree more with Don that although there would be some
short-term pain, I would be very comfortable controlling all of that real estate.
 
Jeffrey S. Berkes
Federal Realty Investment Trust - President & COO
On average, those are low rents. They're $15 or so, which, given our centers, again, on average, is fairly low.

The next question comes from Michael Goldsmith with UBS.
 
Michael Goldsmith
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Associate Director and Associate Analyst
Dan, your commentary about 2023 was really helpful. I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more color about the puts and
takes. It looks like G&A is going to be about $4 million higher. Refinancing this 2023 bond is -- it looks like it could be about a $5 million
headwind. There's also the capitalized interest for [percent kind of less] and that's offsetting some of these factors on the -- of the growth
of the portfolio. So can you just provide a little bit more detail on some of the puts and takes of 2023, so that we know kind of like where
the starting point is in our model before we start to kind of like model the growth upon it?
 
Daniel Guglielmone
Federal Realty Investment Trust - Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer
Yes. No and look, I think you highlighted some of the color I provided on 2023. We are going to provide more detailed comprehensive
with underlying assumptions on our February call. We're in the middle of our budgeting process. We're not done with that, that we need
more visibility, and we'll have more visibility, hopefully, in 3 months, and that's when we'll give you that detailed information and so stay
tuned.
 
Donald C. Wood
Federal Realty Investment Trust - CEO & Director
It's funny, Michael, when -- I had to laugh because when we were preparing comments and what we're -- what Dan was going to say for
2023, I thought he was giving too much at that point. But it's a heck of a try to get more out of us at this point. Stay tuned.
 
Michael Goldsmith
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Associate Director and Associate Analyst
And I appreciate that. Are you able to at least provide kind of where prior period rents collected are, just so that we can we can kind of
quantify around that?
 
Daniel Guglielmone
Federal Realty Investment Trust - Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer
Yes. Yes. No, I think that prior period rent and what we think about and how we're thinking about it currently is what's prior period rent
that we expect to collect that's related to COVID modifications to previous deals with tenants. That's about $8 million to $10 million this
year. It's probably going to be probably in and around $5 million, plus or minus. Use that as a placeholder for now. We'll have more
guidance there. Certainly, a lot less impactful than it was last year in 2021 to '22.

The next question comes from Greg McGinniss from Scotiabank.
 
Greg Michael McGinniss
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division - Analyst
Just looking at residential, comparable occupancy saw a 50 basis point decline year-over-year. Is there anything to point to there? And
then also what level of spreads are you seeing in the residential assets?
 
Donald C. Wood
Federal Realty Investment Trust - CEO & Director
Yes, it's a great question. So you know what that's about, Greg? It's about pushing rents hard, particularly up at Assembly. And so we
were -- we leased that up so fast that as the turns happened, we wanted to push rents to find the equilibrium, lost a point or 2 of
occupancy, which is just fine.
It's funny when you -- and going back even to Steve Sakwa's question earlier, what should this portfolio be leased at? I always say 95% or
so because it's not just about leasing it up and getting the building filled. It's about making the most money with it.
And so the notion of testing where the rates are, where they can be, where they should be relative to occupancy, always makes me more
comfortable in the 95%, 95.5% range. If we're at 97%, 98%, it feels like we're leaving money on the table. So there's nothing more to
look into that -- into it than that. Extremely strong growth. I don't have those numbers actually at either Santana or at Assembly, but
they're strong.
 
Jeffrey S. Berkes
Federal Realty Investment Trust - President & COO
Yes. The year-over-year revenue growth at our stabilized property Assembly Montaje and our stabilized buildings here at Santana Row,
it's kind of low to mid-double digits, Greg? We do have one hand tied behind our back a bit in Montgomery County because of the rent
restrictions there that were just recently lifted and we're starting to work through the rent roll and the Montgomery County assets. But
where we haven't been restricted, the lease trade-outs have been incredible and the year-over-year revenue growth has been incredible.
Also done a good job managing expenses over the past 12 months. So residential has been a great contributor in the company.
 
Greg Michael McGinniss
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division - Analyst
Okay. And then just thinking about tenant retention and the potential for increasing occupancy. Looking at this quarter, new leases
represented 90 basis points of occupancy. Leased rate was only up 20 basis points, though, so 70 basis points to move out during Q3.
How is the tenant retention comparing to prior years? And as we look towards a potentially more challenged economic environment,
thinking in that context, what's driving move-outs today?
 
Donald C. Wood
Federal Realty Investment Trust - CEO & Director
There's a bunch to unload in that question. And I heard something that you said that kind of that I'm not sure the premise is right. Part of
the reason that you don't see occupancy going up as fast as the overall lease volume that we have is because often, we lease space for
which there is already a tenant still there. And the way we think you should show it is if it was occupied before, yes, you're showing it in
your lease rollover, but it's still occupied. So it's not going to change that occupancy number. That's a much bigger component than any
move-outs, if you will, that are diluting the occupancy number.
So I kind of got caught when you said that. That got stuck in my head. It's the part of your question that I wanted to argue about. And I'm
not sure there was anything else in there for me to answer.
 
Operator
Your next question comes from Craig Mailman of Citi.
 
Unidentified Analyst
This is [Seth] on for Craig. I just wanted to go back to your 2022 guidance and the $0.12 increase. Where are kind of the moving pieces in
that guidance? And is there any type of onetime pieces to that?
 
Daniel Guglielmone
Federal Realty Investment Trust - Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer
Yes. With regards to -- we kind of feel as though our 2022 guidance for -- it was just a stronger outlook for the fourth quarter; significant
outperformance in the third quarter. I don't think there's necessarily onetime items in there, except for prior period rent and term fees,
which really third quarter over third quarter, were roughly modest, and I don't see that.
It's just stronger continued expectation that the trends that occurred and our outperformance in the third quarter will continue into the
fourth quarter with regards to continued strong percentage rent; continued strength in occupancy buildup; in our pipeline, tenants taking
possession of space; and then, obviously, with some offset to a higher interest rate environment.
 
Unidentified Analyst
And then just another quick question on Page 25 in the sup, on the comparable new lease summary, it looked like the cash rent spreads
were 0%, but the straight line was 10%. Is that due to like the type of tenants you're leasing to? Or is there anything specific driving that?
 
Daniel Guglielmone
Federal Realty Investment Trust - Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer
Well, the difference between 0 on a cash basis and 10% on a straight line are the rent bumps we're getting. And that's an important
component to consider when you think about rollover is not only what is the rent you're getting at lease maturity to the new market rent,
but what are you collecting along the way? And so the rent bumps that you get are reflected in that straight-line rent rollover number
and we think that's as important, the ramp-ups you get, as the rollover you get at lease end.
 
Operator
The next question comes from Hong Zhang with JPMorgan.
 
Hong Liang Zhang
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Analyst
I think you talked about how your typical lease-to-occupied spread is around 100 to 125 basis points. As we think about commencements
next year, I was wondering where you think that spread could trend to by year-end.
 
Daniel Guglielmone
Federal Realty Investment Trust - Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer
That's a tough one to guide because, one, it's hard to really predict where the lease rate will go. I mean we can get a sense of when leases
will commence and tenants will take possession. So we think our occupied rate should get up towards the -- up into the 93% up towards
-- into the mid-93% range.
 
Donald C. Wood
Federal Realty Investment Trust - CEO & Director
By the end of the year.
 
Daniel Guglielmone
Federal Realty Investment Trust - Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer
By the end of the year. Where -- how much leasing we can continue to do from a leased percentage and what is the holes at the bottom
of the bucket, where that goes is a little bit more difficult for us to forecast. But we should get back to a more normalized level over time.
And I think our goal is to have both components, the metrics, the occupied and the lease metric continue upwards, but narrowing it over
time into 2024 and 2025, probably in that time frame.
 
Donald C. Wood
Federal Realty Investment Trust - CEO & Director
I do want to make another point and make sure you're getting the specific -- what this is all about. The difference between signing a
lease and getting rent started is all based on the tenant construction and the tenants, the permitting process, tenant coordination
process. That's been one of the things that has really dogged this industry for the past 3 years since COVID, supply constrained
environment, the logistical problems, et cetera.
So really, what you want is to get that tight because what that means is the time between a signed lease and the time that a rent starts is
the most important thing. Yes, over COVID, that was going to be exaggerated because you were doing leases in such volume that it took
time to get that rent started. But the objective should be to get that number lower and lower, not necessarily to have it as wide as it can
be because that to me suggests that we're not getting tenants open. And that's really important. So Dan answered it absolutely correctly,
but I just want to make sure that you kind of get what that metric means on an overall basis and how -- why it's so important for us to get
it down to 100 to 125 basis points.
 
Hong Liang Zhang
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Analyst
Yes, agreed. And it looks like you have an option to purchase the remaining interest at Escondido. I was kind of curious if you could talk
about the decision to get that option and what cap rate you would think you could purchase it at right now?
 
Jeffrey S. Berkes
Federal Realty Investment Trust - President & COO
Yes, it's Jeff. We've had a partner of that asset for a very long time, approaching 30 years, that needed some flexibility on their exit from
the asset. So we structured a deal that gave us the option, should we decide to exercise it next year, to go ahead and take them out. I
think the cap rate that we used to value the asset was in the upper 5s. Escondida has been a great property for us over the years, one of
the stronger growers in our West Coast portfolio, so a little bit of a win-win for everybody there.
 
Operator
The next question comes from Juan Sanabria with BMO Capital Markets.
 
Juan Carlos Sanabria
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - MD & Senior U.S. Real Estate Analyst
Just curious on the guidance for same-store NOI and what has been delivered year-to-date and kind of what the exit implied is for the ex
any term fees noise that's caused there. I know you raised the guidance, but just curious on what the fourth quarter implied expectation is
with the upward (inaudible) provide us guidance to think about a number for 2023?
 
Daniel Guglielmone
Federal Realty Investment Trust - Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer
Yes. The number that we report, which is -- includes the headwinds from term fees and prior period rents, in the fourth quarter, should be
about, call it, 3% to 5%, in line with what we did this quarter at 3.7%. Our year-to-date number is 8.8%, which I mentioned, and we
provided 7% to 8% for the year. So the 3% to 5% is what is implied in the fourth quarter is what is implied with the overall guidance. And
obviously, that will be higher we expect because of prior period rent continuing to be higher last year than we expected this year, should
be higher in the fourth quarter than that 3% to 5% range, probably more in the -- something of around 5% to 6%.
 
Juan Carlos Sanabria
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - MD & Senior U.S. Real Estate Analyst
Great. And then just this has been asked a couple of different ways, I guess. But for the small shop tenant space, you're basically at 90%.
So could you just remind us what the prior peak was, how high that could go? And like out of that small shop tenant space, what is kind
of local versus national or regional tenants? And any color on that more local tenant kind of confidence in the credit behind that?
 
Daniel Guglielmone
Federal Realty Investment Trust - Executive VP, CFO & Treasurer
Look, I think we've taken advantage of the opportunity on that note. We've taken advantage of the opportunity to improve the credit of
our small shop tenant base and so forth. And I'll let Wendy answer that in a second, but let me answer the first part of your question.
The peak, which was back to pre-financial crisis, was up around 94%. I think that 92% is kind of a reasonable targeted level that we'll try
and achieve over time on the small shop side.
 
Wendy A. Seher
Federal Realty Investment Trust - Executive VP & Eastern Region President
When I think about the small shops, we certainly had, like everyone did, failures throughout the pandemic. And what we -- what the
result is post pandemic is a pretty savvy and experienced small shop that knows how to get through a difficult time. So I think that our
small shops are pretty on stable ground.
Many of them have better balance sheets than they've had before. They are quite active in making sure that they are maintaining their
locations with us and growing. And certainly, we've always felt that, that local tenant really brings the color and the vibrancy to the
community that we need. So I'm bullish on the small shops.
 
Donald C. Wood
Federal Realty Investment Trust - CEO & Director
Juan, I got to add something to this as I sit and listen. The notion of the question means that there's a premise here that local tenants are
poorer credits than regional tenants. And I have a problem with the premise because what we have found is local tenants by and large,
do whatever they have to do to not lose their space. They borrow money from families, they borrow money from other places that they
have to do and they keep it going.
So if history is any indication here, we would expect, to Wendy's point, as to why the small, small shop, including and maybe especially
the local tenant should outperform here. It is because of those reasons. They're in places that they don't want to lose those shops. So
they do whatever they can to not lose that spot, particularly coming out of COVID, where there has been a complete influx in new money,
in new tenancy and in effectively a robust and solidified small shop base in total.

The next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho.
 
Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division - MD of Americas Research & Senior Equity Research
Analyst
Don, I wanted to go back to some of the earlier comments you made on capital allocation. I understand you're being somewhat
opportunistic selling some assets here, which looks like they'll effectively fund your active redev. But looking ahead, and I know the
macro is uncertain, you have a future pipeline, you alluded to, and there's some -- probably sitting there with some pretty good return
potential. Can you talk a bit about some of these key signals you're looking for before you start on some of those? And should we expect
disposition to be the source of funding?
 
Donald C. Wood
Federal Realty Investment Trust - CEO & Director
Yes, Haendel, it's a great question. And yes, I do expect dispositions to be a key funding source of it. One of the things we're talking about
and looking now and it's premature is it's pretty incredible the value that we've created on some of the residential product that we have.
And it is such a unique funding source.
And again, that's at our big mixed-use properties that such a critical part to getting these places established and moving them along and
now that they're established, we'll look hard at does harvesting that make any sense. And so that will be a component that's in the
consideration of how to fund.
Secondly, the -- when it gets to where to deploy the capital, that deploying of capital is very much dependent on a very localized look at
demand and making the case for the Assembly life science development building. Obviously, we want to see venture capital funding in a
better place than it is today. Obviously, we want to understand what the cost requirements of that -- of building that are.
And so building by building, redevelopment by our redevelopment, very localized in terms of that decision-making process. But again,
the capital -- the sale of particular assets, I just think we have more flexibility and more arrows in our quiver, if you will, to decide how to
get that done than most.
 
Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division - MD of Americas Research & Senior Equity Research
Analyst
Okay. Great. Appreciate that. And a follow-up on redev, but with the focus on Assembly Row, where you paused the life sciences project.
Any update to share there? I see you have some additional entitlements for more resi. Could we see you -- or perhaps would you consider
prioritizing that over life sciences or anything or office there given the growth in supply in the life sciences market in Boston?
 
Donald C. Wood
Federal Realty Investment Trust - CEO & Director
No update to talk about there at this point. I can tell you, it's very important to us that the entitlement process not just for that one
building, but for the adjacencies to that is completed. We're working hard on that during this pause period. That could give us a whole
kind of leg up, if you will, when we are ready to move forward again. I also very much want to see what happens next to us with the
Blackstone financed life science project to the extent they -- who they land is obviously very important to what's happening there.
So the one thing I know that you can get comfortable with us is that we're not formulaic in terms of those decisions. They're very, very
much revenue-based and based on what's happening around us at that particular time. So a bit more time to go to see what and when
there, if you will.

The next question comes from Tayo Okusanya with Credit Suisse.
 
Omotayo Tejamude Okusanya
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division - Analyst
Just kind of given the overall concern of moving into a slower economic cycle, I wondered if you could give us any color in regards to what
you are seeing in regards to how your customer base is behaving. Specifically like office, are they asking for shorter leases? Are they
asking for more flexibility in the leases? Are you starting to see more price sensitivity on the apartment side? Just kind of curious if you
could just kind of give us some color about tenant behavior at this point versus, say, 6 to 12 months ago?
 
Donald C. Wood
Federal Realty Investment Trust - CEO & Director
Yes, Tayo, it's all good stuff that you're asking about. And let me go for a few things that I've noticed along the way there. On the retail
side, very little difference in behavior in terms of getting those lease -- the desirability of getting the space and that's why the pipeline
looks as strong as it does. The question there is it always comes down to what's the construction of the space going to cost. And because
that's uncertain now and in a period of inflation, that slows down the process a little bit.
And so from a behavioral perspective, does it -- will it take longer to get leases done? That's a potential effect of trying to underwrite
construction costs primarily, but not -- got nothing to do with demand. It's got everything to do with the math of getting that done.
In terms of the apartment side, man, you're in a period of time here in the markets we're at where interest rates and home mortgages
going to where they are, make apartments look awfully, awfully attractive. It's why you're seeing the demand that we're seeing. I just
went through the numbers here at Santana Row, it's incredible in terms of the strength of the consumer here as it relates to apartment
spending. And again, the same thing over in Boston with respect to the product that we're offering there.
So for me, it always comes down to, does that consumer have the means to consume? I can tell you, we've got a couple of shopping
centers that are where the demographics are below $75,000 of household income. There is no doubt in our mind that those shopping
centers struggle more than the ones that have $150,000 and $160,000 of consumer -- of household income.
So from our standpoint, this is a portfolio that's very high quality. We certainly have a couple of shopping centers, well, there's a few
shopping centers at the lower end and there's a demonstrable difference. So that's how I kind of look at the consumer.
