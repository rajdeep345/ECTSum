PRESENTATION
 
Operator
Good afternoon, and welcome to Ares Commercial Real Estate Corporation's Conference Call to discuss the company's Third Quarter
2022 financial results. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on November 2, 2022. I will now turn the call over to John
Stilmar from Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
 
John Stilmar
Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today's conference call. I'm joined by our CEO, Bryan Donohoe; Tae-Sik Yoon, our CFO;
and other members of our team.
In addition to our press release and the 10-Q that we filed with the SEC, we have posted an earnings presentation under the Investor
Resources section of our website at www.arescre.com.
Before we begin, I'll remind everyone that comments made during the course of this conference call and webcast and the accompanying
documents contain forward-looking statements and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Many of these forward-looking statements can
be identified by the use of words such as anticipates, believes, expects, intends, will, should, make, and similar such expressions. These
forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations of market conditions and management's judgment. These
statements are not guarantees of future performance, condition or results and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. The
company's actual results could differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements as a result of a number of
factors, including those listed in SEC documents.
Ares Commercial Real Estate Corporation assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements.
During this conference call, we will likely refer to non-GAAP financial measures. We use these as a measure of operating performance,
and these measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. These measures may not be comparable to like-titled measures used by other companies.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to our CEO, Bryan Donohoe.
 
Bryan Patrick Donohoe
Ares Commercial Real Estate Corporation - CEO
Thanks, John, and good afternoon, everybody. This morning, we announced third quarter distributable earnings of $0.39 per share, an
increase of 5% from the third quarter of last year, which exceeded our quarterly regular and supplemental dividends paid of $0.35 per
share. The growth in our distributable earnings was driven primarily by the benefits of rising interest rates and some modest prepayment
fees received. Looking forward, we expect that rising interest rates will continue to have a positive impact on our earnings potential due
to our floating rate loan portfolio and the hedges we have in place on our liabilities.
Now let me touch on a few macroeconomic factors influencing our market. The Federal Reserve is continuing to tighten monetary policy
with an unexpected pace of increases in market rates to combat inflation, which we believe has increased the likelihood of a recession.
These complex macro crosscurrents are driving volatility across most major asset classes, including commercial real estate. Additionally,
these factors are impairing capital formation, as both the capital markets and bank lending have meaningfully retrenched, resulting in
significantly expanded risk premiums.
We believe these conditions are likely to persist for the foreseeable future, and will be challenges for our industry. Because of all this, the
sourcing, informational benefits and deep financing relationships that we derive as part of the Ares platform will be even more important
for us in this type of environment.
We have been focused on property types such as multifamily, industrial and self-storage that have strong underlying rent growth
dynamics, which have muted or outpaced the recent growth in market interest rates. This has been particularly true since we exited the
COVID time period at the end of 2020.
In terms of deployment during the third quarter, we were highly selective. We closed $50 million of floating rate investments across
multifamily and self-storage properties, and $28 million of AAA-rated newly issued CRE liquid debt securities. Across both public and
private market opportunities, we believe that our new investments are in property types and markets with strong underlying demand
drivers to counteract higher rates and risk premiums, while also possessing more conservative structures and wider spreads.
By way of example, during the third quarter, we originated a senior whole loan secured by a portfolio of well-located multifamily
properties in the Sunbelt with a well-regarded repeat sponsor. The all-in spread on the home loan was 80 basis points higher than our
post-pandemic average spreads for multifamily home loans and with a greater equity subordination and enhanced structural terms,
further driving the attractiveness of the loan.
Supported by these attributes and the breadth of Ares' capital markets relationships, we were able to arrange highly efficient senior
financing with an insurance company on this loan with ACRE retaining a $20.6 million mezzanine investment. We view this mezzanine
investment as similar in concept to underwriting and holding a first lien loan on our balance sheet and financing a portion of the loan
with one of our nonrecourse financing sources.
We also took advantage of what we believe are compelling opportunities in the CMBS markets by purchasing $28 million of newly issued
AAA-rated CRE securities, backed by a pool of senior floating rate mortgages. We believe these securities are highly attractive
investments, with weighted average credit spreads of 245 basis points, resulting in unlevered yield today in excess of 6% at current SOFR
rates, all backed by a diversified pool of underlying commercial real estate properties with LTVs of 30% to 40%.
Despite the slower market, we had $167 million of repayments during the third quarter. This level of repayments was in line with our 6
quarter average and included a $30 million hospitality loan, was a risk-rated 4 loan 1 year ago and was repaid at [par] during the third
quarter.
For the fourth quarter, we remain selective on new investments and expect to maintain a strong liquidity position.
Now let me turn the call over to Tae-Sik to walk through our quarterly financial highlights for further details on our portfolio and capital
position.
 
Tae-Sik Yoon
Ares Commercial Real Estate Corporation - CFO & Treasurer
Great. Thank you, Bryan, and good afternoon, everyone. This morning, we reported GAAP net income of $644,000 or $0.01 per share and
distributable earnings of $21.3 million or $0.39 per share. The primary driver of the difference between our third quarter GAAP EPS and
distributable EPS is approximately $19.5 million or about $0.36 per share in CECL provision we recorded during the quarter. This
provision served to increase our overall CECL reserve to $51.9 million or approximately 1.9% of the total commitments of our loan
portfolio, which I will cover shortly in more detail.
Overall, our distributable earnings for the third quarter were supported by the positive benefits of rising interest rates and the continued
contributions from our proactive approach to liability hedging that we put in place in early 2021 when market interest rates were
materially lower than they are today, and allowed us to lock in 1-month LIBOR at 21 basis points.
Turning to our portfolio. We ended the quarter with a loan portfolio consisting of 98% senior loans and an outstanding principal balance
of $2.5 billion across 70 loans. During the third quarter, we collected 99% of our contractual interest due and added 1 new loan to
nonaccrual status. The 3 loans on nonaccrual status represents about 4% of our overall portfolio as of September 30, 2022.
In terms of our other credit quality metrics, 90% of our loan portfolio had a risk rating of 3 or better, which declined from 94% last
quarter and primarily reflects the negative migration of 4 loans during the third quarter. More specifically, the risk ratings on 3 loans,
each backed by office properties, were downgraded from 3 to 4 due to our outlook on their respective business plans and our
macroeconomic viewpoint of their respective submarkets.
In addition, the risk rating of 1 residential loan changed from 4 to 5. Here, we expect the sale of the underlying property in the fourth
quarter below our carrying value, resulting in a loss of approximately $2.4 million should the transaction be consummated.
In terms of our overall CECL reserve, we increased our total reserve by $19.5 million as of the third quarter of 2022, and our total CECL
reserve now stands at $51.9 million or 1.9% of our total loan commitments.
Turning to our capitalization and liquidity. Our borrowing base remains highly diversified across 8 various financing sources. And
importantly, none of these financing structures have spread-based mark-to-market provisions. We have received no margin calls on our
liabilities.
We are also on a very strong liquidity position with approximately $156 million of available capital as of November 1. This includes cash
and amounts available for us to draw under various debt facilities. Additionally, we have $130 million of cash in our FL3 securitization
that can be used to finance new transactions at borrowing spread of (inaudible) a significant discount to today's market. This healthy
level of available capital should benefit us as we selectively invest in an increasingly attractive spread environment, while maintaining a
significant level of liquidity due to uncertain market conditions.
Let me now provide an update on our portfolio positioning and the potential earnings benefits from future increases in short-term
interest rates. 98% of our portfolio, as measured by outstanding principal balance, is comprised of floating rate loans indexed to either 1
month LIBOR or SOFR, resulting in our portfolio being positioned to benefit from further increases in the respective indices. None of our
LIBOR floors, which provided us with significant incremental revenues from the past 2 years, are currently in effect, which means that
98% of our assets are currently sensitive to further increases in base interest rates.
In comparison, as we hedge -- as we have hedged a meaningful portion of our floating rate debt through interest rate swaps or borrowed
on a fixed rate basis in the case of our term loan, about 1/3 of our liabilities are not sensitive to increases in base interest rates. This
means that ACRE is well positioned to benefit from today's rising rate environment. For example, on a pro forma basis, if LIBOR was 100
basis points higher than the actual September 30, 2022 levels and all other aspects of our portfolio remain constant as of the same date,
our annualized distributable earnings as of the third quarter of 2022 would have been higher by approximately $11 million or $0.20 per
share on a pro forma basis.
Finally, this morning, we announced a fourth quarter 2022 regular dividend of $0.33 per common share, as well as a continuation of our
supplemental quarterly dividend of $0.02 per common share.
So with that, let me turn the call back over to Bryan for some closing remarks.
 
Bryan Patrick Donohoe
Ares Commercial Real Estate Corporation - CEO
Thanks, Tae-Sik. We recognize the challenges that rising interest rates and future economic uncertainty are expected to have on certain
real estate properties. We believe Ares Commercial Real Estate remains well positioned to navigate the changing economic landscape.
Our balance sheet continues to be in great shape with moderate leverage, no spread-based mark-to-market sources of financing and a
strong level of available capital.
While the competitive landscape remains highly favorable, we are finding opportunities to invest in higher-yielding opportunities with
better structural terms. We expect to remain highly selective in order to preserve our strong liquidity position during what we expect
could continue to be a volatile period.
With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 
Operator
(Operator Instructions) The first question we have on the phone lines comes from Steven Delaney of JMP.
 
Steven Cole Delaney
JMP Securities LLC, Research Division - MD, Director of Mortgage & Real Estate Finance Research & Equity
Research Analyst
I'm curious on the securities purchases. Do you -- as you look at that market opportunity, are you looking at -- obviously, you mentioned
CMBS, so you're also looking at CLOs given how those have been -- have blown out and also the floating rate feature there, just curious.
And maybe just while, and to make the response easy, also, you're buying those at an attractive rate. But are you using a bit of repo
financing to get yourself to sort of a target low double-digit return?
 
Bryan Patrick Donohoe
Ares Commercial Real Estate Corporation - CEO
Yes, absolutely. Thanks for the question, Steve. I think we actually think there's some compelling structural features within the CLO
market as well. So between the two, we're somewhat agnostic, and you can certainly see a little bit of both. Thus far, we have not sought
to lever those. So it's kind of a combination of both yield and liquidity thus far. There are some features in the market that we've been
hesitant to utilize leverage against effectively mark-to-market securities like this. So that's something we've been somewhat hesitant to
do with the volatility around us. We're exploring various structures to mitigate some of that, but it's certainly an attractive period of time
to be up in the stack where spreads have candidly widened more than some of the mezzanine bonds as well.
 
Steven Cole Delaney
JMP Securities LLC, Research Division - MD, Director of Mortgage & Real Estate Finance Research & Equity
Research Analyst
Okay. Great. And one quick follow-up. I couldn't find the article, but I recall in looking at commercial mortgage alert over the last 4 to 5
weeks, that there was a mention of sort of a resurgence in Freddie Mac Q-Series, and I believe in one of the articles that referenced ACRE
specifically. And I'm just curious, I know you like multifamily, is that something you're looking at as a financing alternative to do a
Q-Series deal with Freddie?
 
Bryan Patrick Donohoe
Ares Commercial Real Estate Corporation - CEO
Yes. I'm not familiar with the article. To date, we have not explored the space. But in times of volatility, that has been somewhat of a safe
harbor and also an interesting yield play. That clearly tightened over the last 5 or so years to where it was less interesting to us as a broad
platform, not even specific to ACRE. It's not outside the realm of possibility, but not something we've explored to date.
 
Operator
Your next question comes from Jade Rahmani of KBW.
 
Jade Joseph Rahmani
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division - Director
Just broadly speaking, in the office space, do you think that it's primarily an issue of liquidity or lack thereof driving these heightened
CECL reserves that the commercial mortgage REITs are taking as well as, in a few cases, loans at maturity default? Or do you think
there's a more fundamental reassessment of office going on and that's adding to the valuation multiple decline that we're seeing?
 
Bryan Patrick Donohoe
Ares Commercial Real Estate Corporation - CEO
It's a good question, Jade. I think there's some crosscurrents in the space, clearly, where in certain markets and in certain assets, there's
just less demand on the rental side. That's counteracted by certain assets where, despite the volatility, you've got high degrees of cash
flow or longer-term leases that are part of the attractive part of the office sector in times of more normal liquidity and a little bit more
equilibrium.
I think that, as I said, I think there's crosscurrents where there's some regulatory and other pressures to reduce office exposure in the
banking sector. So that's flowing through. And all of that contributes as your question points to towards how CECL treats this.
 
Jade Joseph Rahmani
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division - Director
The CECL reserve, firstly, I want to confirm nearly all of it was a general reserve, only the $2.4 million was loan-specific. But more broadly
speaking, did you review every loan and near-term upcoming maturities and the risk of maturity default there and take that into account?
What are you expecting on the loan maturity side?
 
Tae-Sik Yoon
Ares Commercial Real Estate Corporation - CFO & Treasurer
Sure, Jade. Thanks for that question. Yes, this is Tae-Sik. So to answer your first question, yes. Of the $19.5 million, we mentioned that
there was one loan that had the $2.5 million in terms of specific. Again, the change in the $19.5 million, just to clarify, was not all due to
that $2.5 million, that $2.5 million already -- I'm sorry, $2.4 million already had a $1.5 million general reserve prior quarter. So that
specific net change was really just the $900,000. But the remainder of the $19.5 million that you mentioned, that is all due to sort of
changes in the general reserve under CECL.
And then to answer your second question, clearly, one of the factors that go into the CECL model is the maturity data loan. So when a
loan is 3 years out versus 3 months out, it does have a different impact on the CECL model. It definitely also has an impact on our outlook
of what that property will be performing at the time of the maturity. And obviously, the closer you get to maturity, the more specific and
the more precise, if you want to call it, we can be about it. So to answer your question, yes, the maturity date is definitely taken into
consideration as part of the overall CECL reserve analysis.
 
Jade Joseph Rahmani
Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division - Director
And on the 4 risk-rated, 4 bucket, $234 million, how many loans is that? And over what period do you expect some kind of resolution?
 
Bryan Patrick Donohoe
Ares Commercial Real Estate Corporation - CEO
Yes. Again, if you look at the 4 rated loans, I believe there are 6 of them. And in terms of when they will be resolved. The good news is
there is just a few that have sort of near-term maturities. But certainly, all 6 are the focus of various intense asset management led by our
team. We are in very, very close dialogue with each of the borrowers about the progress of the business plan, restructuring some of the
loan terms if necessary.
But again, I think they are all in various stages of completing their business plans. But the good news is there are a couple with some
near maturities. The others do not have near-term maturities, but they are all being very, very actively pursued in terms of working very
close to borrowers to make sure that we do everything we can to work with the borrowers to meet their business plans.
 
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Rick Shane with JPMorgan.
 
Richard Barry Shane
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Equity Analyst
I think Jade is honed in on the same issue that I am, which is that when we look at the portfolio, they're obviously in the next 3 months
some pretty significant maturities. And then when you extend that to 6 months, an even greater percentage of the portfolio is maturing.
One question, and I apologize, I should know this, but I'm just looking at the slide deck, I can't remember off the top of my head. Is the
maturity date that you're showing, the original maturity date or the fully extended maturity date?
 
Tae-Sik Yoon
Ares Commercial Real Estate Corporation - CFO & Treasurer
The date we're showing is the initial maturity date. Some as we mentioned...
 
Richard Barry Shane
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Equity Analyst
So should we assume that for most loans that are shown there with you can calculate pretty easily is a 3-year initial maturity probably do
have at least 1, if not 2, extensions available?
 
Tae-Sik Yoon
Ares Commercial Real Estate Corporation - CFO & Treasurer
Yes. I would say our standard loans do have built-in extensions. Generally 1 or 2 -- 1-year extensions. But most often, they are
accompanied by some level of requirements that are necessary for them to be met, whether it's LTV, debt yield, certainly no existence of
default, potentially payment of fees, different interest rates. But generally, there are built-in requirements about debt yield or LTVs.
 
Richard Barry Shane
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Equity Analyst
Got it. And I understood that there is a toll that you can extract for those extensions, and that's frankly just part of the business -- is part
of the business model, not to dismiss that. When you are looking specifically at those loans within the portfolio, what's noteworthy is
given the changes in the market and where you've been concentrating in terms of originations, disproportionately the pending maturities
are in the office space, which I think is, generally speaking, of greater concern right now. Do you believe that these sponsors are in
position, both financially in terms of the covenants and also from a willingness to extend? Or do you think that there are going to be -- we
saw recently a deal from a competitor of yours, do you think that, that type of activity is just going to pick up?
 
Tae-Sik Yoon
Ares Commercial Real Estate Corporation - CFO & Treasurer
So I think we absolutely deal with each situations differently. I think if you look at our historical practice, we have been very -- working
again very closely with each borrower to make sure we give them every opportunity to continue to meet their business plans. I'd say most
often, we have asked for some level of concessions in order to provide an extension of their loans, right? Whether that is some sort of fee,
whether that's an increase in the interest rate, and probably most often, some material contribution of additional equity capital to show
their continued sponsorship in the deal.
But again, our goal is to continue to work with each of our borrowers to give them every opportunity for success. We want them
committed, both from an effort perspective, as well as capital perspective. At this point, I would say there are situations where, again, it's
ongoing discussions. I don't think we have situations where we have borrowers ready to throw us the key, if you want to call it that way.
But certainly, borrowers do behave as an economic animal, and we do understand the situations in which they may be motivated to do
so. And so again, we evaluate each of these situations very uniquely, individually. It depends on the borrower, it depends on the building,
it depends on the submarket, it depends on so many different situations that it's hard to give a generic response. But again, I do think we
do work very closely with each borrower to make sure that we have the best solution for us and for them.
 
Bryan Patrick Donohoe
Ares Commercial Real Estate Corporation - CEO
Yes. Maybe I'll just add on to that, Tae-Sik, if I could, which is another avenue, I kind of intimated is when we do have higher cash flowing
assets, right, and if you think about one of the benefits of office product is longer duration leases than you might see, for instance, in the
apartment complex, that additional cash flow to the extent we're working through a period of illiquidity in the space can be rerouted
through our cash management structure and pay down the loan or use it or held this additional collateral. So I think Tae-Sik did a good
job of covering all the different avenues in which we actively manage in the space. And certainly, the macro overlay is a challenge, but
one we're working through on an asset-by-asset basis.
 
Richard Barry Shane
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Equity Analyst
Got it. And look, I will make the observation that strategically over the decade that we've followed you, the behavior has always been to
work with borrowers. I mean, I think there are ends of the continuum in terms of aggressive resolution versus really partnering with
borrowers. And I'm not opining which I think is better or worse. I think it depends upon the lender. But I think that the long history of your
company is to really try to work with the sponsors and keep them in the properties.
 
Bryan Patrick Donohoe
Ares Commercial Real Estate Corporation - CEO
I think that's right. Obviously, at Ares, we have our DNA in credit, and we know certainly have the ability across the spectrum to step into
those situations in which there is value add that comes from the broader company expertise. But at the end of the day, our charter, if you
will, is to be a lender to these borrowers, to work with them through some of the cloudier times and get to a better environment and
really maximize value at the asset level, and that creates kind of some win-win situations, and certainly, some brand loyalty there. But I
think your take is correct.
 
Richard Barry Shane
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Equity Analyst
Yes. You don't want to be running a hotel in White Plains ever again?
 
Bryan Patrick Donohoe
Ares Commercial Real Estate Corporation - CEO
Not during COVID at least.
 
Operator
We now have Doug Harter from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
 
Douglas Michael Harter
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division - Director
Can you just talk about a little bit more about the decision to allocate capital to AAA CMBS? And kind of except, obviously, a lower risk,
but lower return and how that compares and how you're thinking about the timing of holding that capital versus deploying it into loans
at likely higher returns?
 
Bryan Patrick Donohoe
Ares Commercial Real Estate Corporation - CEO
Yes. It was really a balance of the risk spectrum. And clearly, there's been a slowdown in transaction activity throughout the real estate
space. We're coming off of a record transaction volume year last year. So still enough to do. And we actually are pretty happy with the
lending environment. We're seeing great opportunities. So it's a fair question.
We just felt the relative value to be able to print those tickets when we did with the additional upside, as we said on the first question
about the potential to lever those if given the right structure into a pretty interesting overall yield. But the combination of the unlevered
yield plus the liquidity, that is inherent in those securities, made it something that was fairly compelling at the time. Again, we don't see
it as changing the mandate here, right? We are going to be first mortgage lenders to commercial real estate borrowers in the top
markets, et cetera, that you've heard us talk about previously. But at the time, given the dearth of transactions and a few of the
crosscurrents we've mentioned, we felt it was pretty compelling.
 
Douglas Michael Harter
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division - Director
Makes sense. And then, Tae-Sik, I think you said that the CLO or one of the CLOs has had $130 million of cash. What is the timeframe for
reinvestment? Or what is -- how much longer is there on the reinvestment rights for that CLO?
 
Tae-Sik Yoon
Ares Commercial Real Estate Corporation - CFO & Treasurer
Sure. We mentioned that we have about $130 million of capacity that we could put into the CLO. This is our FL3 securitization. And again,
one of the benefits of that securitization is we've managed to extend that revolving period for a number of times, again, really taking
advantage of that, that there's really one participant who holds all of the investment-grade notes in that CLO.
So we still have a decent amount of time to put in some additional collateral. We're still also hopeful that even when that expires, we'll
continue to be able to renew it. I think we are, right now, in our third revolving period. And so we do anticipate and hope that we can
continue to do it. But clearly, we're hopeful that we can put the $130 million to work very soon well within the allotted time period of the
replacement period.
 
Douglas Michael Harter
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division - Director
And I guess, what limitations would there be for deployment there? Or would we expect that kind of the first $130 million of the loans you
do would kind of go into that CLO?
 
Tae-Sik Yoon
Ares Commercial Real Estate Corporation - CFO & Treasurer
Yes. So one of the limitations, of course, is that the owner of the investment-grade notes has the right to approve. We have obviously
worked with them over the many years to make sure that the collateral we do put that, we put in FL3 is consistent with our thesis and
their thesis. So we don't certainly anticipate having challenges of identifying the right type of assets that go into it. But Bryan, do you
want to add?
 
Bryan Patrick Donohoe
Ares Commercial Real Estate Corporation - CEO
Yes. I would just add that I think the reason we set up this partnership a few years back was because I think we are like-minded. And
when we speak to that investor, which we do clearly regularly. And first of all, I think you cite one of our true priorities is to use that
liability structure given the in-the-money nature of it. But we have a like-minded viewpoint on the market landscape. And when we think
about the opportunity set in front of us as commercial real estate lenders, they share the view that, that it is a very compelling time to
take advantage of the dislocation.
So, one, it's a priority for us; and two, it's something that we will approach in concert with this partner that we've put in place for a
number of years.
 
Operator
(Operator Instructions) We have our next question from Eric Hagen with BTIG.
 
Eric J. Hagen
BTIG, LLC, Research Division - Research Analyst
How are you finding in your conversations, both with sponsors and in your underwriting, the impact of hedging interest rate risk against
the backdrop of higher rates and volatility? How would you say the hedging of that risk has filtered into CRE values in the way that you
guys reserve for credit?
 
Bryan Patrick Donohoe
Ares Commercial Real Estate Corporation - CEO
Yes, it's a good question. It's been a pretty amazing like dynamic. I think you saw in our commentary and some others, the velocity of the
rate change has been pretty significant. I would say as we converse with borrowers throughout our broad portfolio, it really is being
handled both, I would say, systematically as well as taking into account the expected further duration of the asset.
When you take the risk premium associated with rate caps plus the way they're functioning today, which is effectively just prepaying
interest in certain ways, we're trying to be logical and reasonable about how we do that, while making sure that we protect interest rates
to the downside to the extent that the pivot we're all hearing about in real time doesn't necessarily come to be. So it's a conversation
we're having quite often.
And our view, clearly, as Tae-Sik has mentioned today and in prior quarters, we've generally taken advantage of rates in certain
environments. Right now, I think it's both defensive and really focusing on the underlying credit of the asset. But Tae-Sik, I don't know if
you have anything to add there.
 
Tae-Sik Yoon
Ares Commercial Real Estate Corporation - CFO & Treasurer
Yes. Bryan, I think those are (inaudible) my thoughts. One of the other challenges, obviously, is a few years ago, it was very inexpensive
for borrowers to buy interest rate protection. It is something that we have generally required. Sometimes, it was met with a little bit of
resistance. But I think even those counterparties, those borrowers, obviously look back on it as having done the right thing. I think as
Bryan mentioned, today, with the rate volatility and the absolute higher rates, it's obviously much more expensive to put in a cap or any
other types of interest rate protection. And I think borrowers, fortunately, see the value of doing so. So I think there's less resistance to
doing it, but there is more of a monetary limitation to the cost of putting in interest rate protection.
 
Eric J. Hagen
BTIG, LLC, Research Division - Research Analyst
Right. That's helpful. In the case where a loan does get extended, does the borrower need to execute a new, call it, at-the-market interest
rate cap?
 
Tae-Sik Yoon
Ares Commercial Real Estate Corporation - CFO & Treasurer
Yes. That's a great question. I mean, that is certainly a very, very live question that we face every day. And again, we do push it very hard.
That is one of the things that we want to make sure that we and the borrowers are protected against further increases in interest rates.
And again, I don't think there is a resistance in terms of wanting to do so. But again, it may come down to affordability of what those
interest rate caps and other protection mechanisms will cost to put in place.
So it is certainly something that we push very hard for. But again, it's all part of the overall negotiation of what we would seek to have in
place in order for us to consent to an extension.
 
Operator

In the conference calls upon which Event Briefs are based, companies may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding a variety of items. Such forward-looking statements are based
upon current expectations and involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those stated in any forward-looking statement based on a number of important factors and risks,
which are more specifically identified in the companies' most recent SEC filings. Although the companies may indicate and believe that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements are
reasonable, any of the assumptions could prove inaccurate or incorrect and, therefore, there can be no assurance that the results contemplated in the forward-looking statements will be realized.
THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN EVENT BRIEFS REFLECTS REFINITIV'S SUBJECTIVE CONDENSED PARAPHRASE OF THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S CONFERENCE CALL AND THERE MAY BE
MATERIAL ERRORS, OMISSIONS, OR INACCURACIES IN THE REPORTING OF THE SUBSTANCE OF THE CONFERENCE CALLS. IN NO WAY DOES REFINITIV OR THE APPLICABLE COMPANY ASSUME
ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY INVESTMENT OR OTHER DECISIONS MADE BASED UPON THE INFORMATION PROVIDED ON THIS WEB SITE OR IN ANY EVENT BRIEF. USERS ARE ADVISED TO
REVIEW THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S CONFERENCE CALL ITSELF AND THE APPLICABLE COMPANY'S SEC FILINGS BEFORE MAKING ANY INVESTMENT OR OTHER DECISIONS.
