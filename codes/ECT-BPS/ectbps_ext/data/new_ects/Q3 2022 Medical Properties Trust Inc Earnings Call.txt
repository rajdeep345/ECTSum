Thank you, Charles, and thanks to all of you for joining today on our third quarter 2022 earnings call.
While economic uncertainty and inflationary pressures continue to weigh on investors and businesses worldwide, we are seeing some
positive trends over the last couple of months within the health care sector that are worth noting. Volumes have fluctuated throughout
2022, but August saw increasing volumes, which have provided a good boost in revenues. So while our trailing 12-month coverages may
see marginal declines as grant funds roll out of the prior periods, we're seeing positive trends in quarter-over-quarter and August over
July discrete coverages.
As we have previously discussed, our operators, especially the general acute care facilities have experienced the same general conditions
and environments as have all hospital systems, including HCA, Tenet and others. Our operators have been executed on initiatives to
reduce contract labor utilization and at the same time, negotiate more favorable pricing for contract labor that remains in place due to
short staffing. In February of this year, our operators experienced the highest level of contract labor, but have subsequently seen a
decline through the month of August. A similar decline has occurred in overall salaries, wages and benefits.
I want to take a moment to remind everyone the nature of reimbursement for hospitals. Generally speaking, hospitals are paid after
services are rendered. And more notably, these rates are adjusted at various intervals based on prior year's data. What this means is that
reimbursement rates are not currently reflective of the increase in cost of care for patients that hospitals have incurred over the last year
or two. CMS will catch up. Remember, historically, Medicare rates have on a whole outpaced inflation.
It is also important to note that our operators contract with and are reimbursed by numerous distinct payers. The terms of these
contracts generally range from 1 to 3 years. Our operators are actively negotiating new contracts with their payers and expect to be
successful in negotiating increased reimbursement rates that are even greater than CMS increases. It may not be immediate and all at
once, but it is coming and in an escalating manner. As our operators effectively work to bring down cost and as reimbursement rates
increase, we expect to continue to see coverages improving within our portfolio.
As our operators are adjust their debt, we are confident they will continue to be successful. This is a long-term investment. And while we
focus along with our operators on the month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter metrics, we are more focused with the long-term strength of
our portfolio of assets. It can become too easy to lose the forest through the trees by myopically focusing on monthly spike in contract
labor or coverages quarter after quarter. Our underwriting and managing of these assets are not done in a vacuum nor on a
quarter-to-quarter time span. We see the forest, we've seen our portfolio go through numerous cycles over the years. Hospitals have
always adapted to whatever the new norm and then they do it again.
Earlier this month, Pipeline announced that it has filed for a petition for reorganization relief under Chapter 11 protection. Many of the
financial challenges for the Pipeline organization involved their hospitals in Chicago. As a reminder, MPT does not own or lease those
hospitals to Pipeline. We own Pipeline's 4 Los Angeles hospitals. We remain confident in Pipeline as an operator, especially considering
the value of our hospital properties that serve a vital need in their respective L.A. communities. We understand the decision to restructure
as it will provide the flexibility and implement sustainable strategies for the corporation going forward.
We fully expect that our rents will continue to be paid and our hospitals will continue to serve their respective communities during the
duration of the bankruptcy process.
Over the past couple of decades, MPT has successfully underwritten tens of billions of dollars in health care real estate. And in that time,
we've had very few operators go through the bankruptcy process. Our success rate is not perfect, but it's pretty darn close. Last quarter,
we provided an investor update report on our website that details some of these occurrences where we've had needed to replace or
transition operators, not all of which were the result of bankruptcy. In almost all of these situations, there was no interruption of services
provided to the communities by these essential assets. Rents continue to be paid, and we were successfully able to transition the in-place
lease agreements to new tenants.
Regarding coverages for the 12 months ending June 30 of this year, we continue to see the impact of the COVID grant monies rolling off
the trailing 12-month period. However, as I stated earlier, we are seeing positive increases in quarter-over-quarter coverages. This is
being bolstered by increased volumes and decreases in contract labor and overall salary, wages and benefits. Our lease coverages or
amounts are spelled out in detail in our supplement filed this morning with our earnings release, but there are a few points that I'd like to
highlight.
We are almost at the point where no COVID grants will be included in the trailing 12 months. The EBITDARM coverage for the trailing 12
months ending June 30 with or without grant is only 7 basis points apart. Another very important point to note is that the coverages for
our total portfolio and each separate category of hospitals saw an increase in coverage during the second quarter over the first quarter.
The total portfolio was up 40 basis points, up 60 basis points for acute care, up 10 basis points for inpatient rehabs, up 20 basis points
for behavioral health, and up 90 basis points for our long-term acute care facilities.
And before turning the call over to Steve, let me outline the strong operating performance that Steward is reporting to us. Unadjusted
EBITDA for the second quarter was approximately $51 million. The third quarter is expected to be more than $30 million. Fiscal year '22
unadjusted EBITDA is projected to be between $50 million and $80 million. Contract labor in Q3 fiscal year '22 has decreased 30% from
Q1 FY '22 run rate and is expected to decline an incremental 20% in Q4, resulting in a 50% decline since the first quarter of this year.
Steward is also forecasting unadjusted EBITDA of more than $350 million for fiscal year '23. Steve?
 
R. Steven Hamner
Medical Properties Trust, Inc. - Founder, Executive VP, CFO & Director
Thank you, Ed. This morning, we reported normalized FFO of $0.45 per diluted share, in line with our prior expectations, including slight
dilution relative to our previously announced use of capital recycling proceeds to continue our reduction in leverage. As this morning's
press release noted, we have refined our 2022 calendar year estimate to a range of $1.80 to $1.82 per share, simply narrowing the
previous range to the higher end.
Implied fourth quarter results primarily consider a full quarter impact of the third quarter recycling activity and higher interest rates.
Adjustments to normalized FFO are routine and immaterial individually and in the aggregate, but I will be happy to address any
questions you have about this during our Q&A.
Let's review MPT's reliable, sustainable and inflation-protected cash-based business model. Year-to-date, as of September 30, MPT had
collected 99% of contractual rents. In the interest of accuracy and transparency, however, I will point out the following definitional
considerations.
First, as we reported last quarter, MPT supported Steward and Prospect with loan facilities, and I will review these momentarily. Second,
in earlier quarters of 2022, we allowed 1 non-U.S. tenant relationship to defer $7 million of rent over 4 months. That tenant is now back
to paying 100% of rent, and will repay the amounts deferred with interest over 12 months starting in January. And finally, many U.S.
states have so-called Supplemental Medicaid programs that basically collect an assessment or a tax on all hospitals in the state. This
aggregate assessment is often matched by the federal government and then is periodically allocated to the state's hospitals based on
each hospital's relative provision of services to eligible patients.
There is frequently a long gap between payment into the fund and receipt of distributions from the fund, often in excess of a year or
more. And for some hospitals, this represents a meaningful portion of periodic reimbursement. Some of our leases are negotiated with
these timing gaps in mind by allowing limited deferral of rents based on the specific statutory provisions of each element of the
supplemental program in that state. In which case, the deferred rent is paid to the landlord when the state distributes the supplemental
funds.
As of the end of the third quarter, $24 million of such deferred rent has been recorded. This will be satisfied over the next 9 quarters.
Just as important as MPT's historical rent collection performance, is the likelihood that we will sustain that collection performance in the
future. And we currently expect that we will continue that level of collection performance over the long term. I'll make a few tenant
specific comments that we hope will relate to you our own confidence in our continued collection of rents, including rents from some of
the real estate that has attracted attention in recent periods and we'll start with Steward.
Steward has faced the same operational, staffing, COVID-related revenue, inflationary and other pressures that the overall U.S. hospital
environment has dealt with for well over 2 years. As we discussed in detail on last quarter's call, during this time, Steward's cash flow has
been burdened by having to repay to CMS, the vast majority of MAP advances approximating $450 million.
Delayed Medicaid reimbursement in Texas of about $70 million. The revenue impact of State of Massachusetts mandated elective
procedure restrictions earlier this year. And finally, Steward's $300 million-plus cash investments in and working capital support for the
5 acute care hospitals in South Florida acquired about a year ago.
When we reported to you 3 months ago, Steward was in the middle of managing its cash flow to satisfy these cash requirements. Since
then, and again, with some assistance from MPT, Steward has weathered this cash strain and is now on the flip side of these
circumstances and expects to be strongly cash flow positive starting with the fourth quarter of 2022.
I'll call out a few additional indicators of Steward's long-term capacity, which we hope will make even more clear why our second quarter
loan to Steward was a prudent and profitable investment. Remember that HCA valued Steward's Utah operations and solely the Utah
operations at $850 million. This transaction ultimately did not occur, but only because of the antitrust position of the FTC.
But the value of Steward's Utah operations did not suddenly go away just because 1 particular operator faced antitrust issues. Steward,
of course, still owns these valuable assets, and has the option to continue to operate Utah on its own and generate strong after-rent cash
flow as it is doing now or to explore monetization of the Utah operations by selling to other prospective purchasers, who would not face
the level of antitrust scrutiny that HCA often attracts.
Under either scenario and whoever is the operator in Utah, the community infrastructure-like characteristics of MPT's Utah real estate
assets should result in profitability and cash flow to pay MPT's rent at attractive coverage levels.
Similarly, earlier this year, MPT sold a 50% joint venture interest in our Massachusetts real estate that is leased to Steward. The JV
simultaneously placed secured debt on that real estate and MPT recognized an approximate $600 million gain on the sale and received
an aggregate of $1.3 billion in cash. The self-evident point to be made is that 2 very sophisticated institutional investors, the
infrastructure funds and the lender did substantial diligence on the operations, cash flow and value of Steward's Massachusetts
operations, and concluded that MPT's contractual rents on its real estate were well supported.
Again, the value of those operations has not suddenly gone away.
MPT also owns 9 hospitals in Florida that are leased to Steward, where operations since last year, when Steward acquired 5 of these
hospitals from Tenet, have continued to improve. And by the way, performance was very attractive even from the time of acquisition.
These 3 markets, Utah, Massachusetts and Florida, comprise nearly 75% of Steward's total annualized rental obligations. On a weighted
average basis, Steward's EBITDARM coverage in these markets has ranged from 2.7x for the trailing 12 months ended June 30, 2022, to
in excess of 3x preliminarily for a stand-alone August. With these coverages, Steward appears well able to continue paying MPT rent.
And that, of course, is the cornerstone principle behind MPT's very long-term track record of buying hospital real estate that needs to be
-- needs to continue operating in order to serve the critical health care needs of people in its community. It is by identifying those physical
and market characteristics in the real estate we invest in, that has led to MPT avoiding renegotiation of rents or other impairments over
our almost 19-year history. And this is why during the earlier part of this year when Steward was working out the issues I just described,
that MPT elected to fund a loan to Steward rather than require Steward to borrow from another lender.
Another lender would have required MPT to relinquish our existing and powerful security position in the value of Steward's best
operations, a position we have by virtue of our master lease, security agreements and intercreditor agreements. We elected instead to
retain this key position and value for ourselves for relatively little incremental exposure, all while earning an attractive return for doing
so.
A brief update on Prospect. First, we announced a few weeks ago that the Yale New Haven Health System has agreed to acquire
Prospect's Connecticut facility, including our real estate, which we expect to sell for approximately $457 million, of which cash proceeds
from Yale are expected to compromise a substantial majority. That is equivalent to the original investment we made about 3 years ago.
In addition to the expected recovery of our original investment, since that acquisition 3 years ago, Prospect has paid us cash rents of
about $104 million. Some analysts and investors have opined that our Prospect investments are not among our stronger assets. And
while we will not comment on that observation this morning, if it is true, then the Yale transactions will be an especially notable financial
result for our shareholders and for our underwriting. That is an investment considered weaker, nonetheless generates a strong unlevered
cash return and recovery of the original investment, all during the worst economic and health crisis in over a century.
Yale's attraction to these facilities is a good example of why we think hospital real estate should not be valued based solely or even
primarily on the financial performance of any particular operator during any particular time period. And while we monitor and report on
lease coverage ratios only for directional indications. It is critical for a successful investor in hospital real estate to understand the value
that a specific facility has to the health care needs of the community it serves. And just because the goals and periodic performance of 1
particular operator are not met in a certain location, does not at all mean that the performance of other operators cannot satisfy their
own goals, resulting in a real estate investor enjoying attractive, well underwritten returns.
On our second quarter earnings call, we said that while we were unable to discuss certain potential and confidential Prospect
transactions, that we had reason to believe that such transactions would result in MPT's avoidance of material impairment or loss with
respect to Prospect. We continue to be prohibited from disclosures about confidential discussions, but we remain cautiously optimistic
about repayment in the relatively near term of the related second quarter $100 million increase in our original 2019 first lien mortgage
loan.
Of course, there is no assurance that any pending transactions, including possible repayments of mortgage loans in the near term, will
occur.
Let's briefly review our strong capital and liquidity position. Our quarter end cash and revolver capacity provides about $1.5 billion in
immediately available liquidity. Recall that earlier this year, in recognition of inevitable inflationary and interest rate pressures, MPT
restated and amended our $2 billion revolving credit facility and extended its term to mature with extension options to June of 2026. In
addition to the $1.5 billion, we have, of course, announced expected proceeds in 2023's first half from pending transactions that is
Springstone and Yale of up to another $650 million.
Our earliest debt maturity is more than a year in the future when our GBP 400 million-pound sterling issue comes due in December
2023. Next in sequence to mature in 2024 is our approximately USD dollar equivalent $750 million term loan, the proceeds of which
were used in 2019 to fund our acquisition of the Healthscope portfolio in Australia. Beyond that is a well-laddered maturity schedule of
our various unsecured notes, which is detailed in our third quarter supplemental package.
Looking forward to possible uses of our liquidity, it is evident that capital costs are not generally favorable for significant investments in
today's global economic environment, and our situation is not different than other investors. Year-to-date, we have invested, subject to
foreign currency fluctuations, about $750 million, and most of these investments were made early this year.
For the foreseeable future, any additional acquisitions will require compelling economics, limited use of liquidity, and strategic support of
opportunities presented to us by our strong operator relationships. Other evident uses may include reduction of debt and repurchase of
our very attractively priced common shares. But even without use of capital for new investments, our inflation-linked lease revenue
should result in substantial internal and highly accretive rent growth, especially given recent global inflation.
We continue to selectively explore additional opportunities to recycle invested capital through specific one-off asset sales and larger
portfolio transactions. Although we are not prepared to make any announcements this morning.
Finally, MPT's long-standing, consistent and successful business model has always been to invest in hospital real estate that regardless
of the operator is underwritten to generate sustainable, long-term cash rental revenue. The key investment criteria for this success is our
acquisition of real estate that is critical to the delivery of hospital services in any particular community. We consider it a mistake for real
estate investors or analysts to assess hospital value based primarily on periodically volatile operating results instead of the important
characteristics of the underlying real estate.
Our unequaled results in rent collections through many years of operating volatility related to disruptive regulatory changes, the 2008
financial crisis, reimbursement uncertainties and evolving payment methodologies, Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act, and its
continuing disruptions, uncertainties and after effects, three years of an unprecedented global pandemic that included virtually closing
many hospitals for months. And most recently, previously unseen disruptions to hospital employment and compensation along with
generationally high spikes in inflation and disconnect between reimbursement and cost levels. Our unequaled results validate our skill in
investing in the kind of hospital real estate that maximize our likelihood of continued long-term success.
With that, we have time for a few questions, and I'll turn the call back over to the operator.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Vikram Malhotra from Mizuho.
 
Vikram L. Malhotra
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division - MD
Maybe I just want to start off with Steward. You referenced the value that was ascribed to the real estate. You also referenced the
unadjusted EBITDA improving for potentially 2023. So given all of that, I'm just wondering 2 things. One, any sense or any update you
can give on your own thoughts on them getting the permanent ABL extension? And then second, given the improvement in the value,
can you just give us a sense of like other parties that may be wanting to buy certain select Steward operations? How close is that
something on the table? Or is it just highly envisioned right now?
 
R. Steven Hamner
Medical Properties Trust, Inc. - Founder, Executive VP, CFO & Director
Thanks, Vikram. On the ABL, what Steward announced a few weeks ago was that they had an extension until the middle of December,
and during which time they expected to complete documentation requirements to presumably extend that for a full year beyond the time
they deliver those documentation requirements. It's our understanding that the primary documentation is delivery of the 2021 audited
financial statements, and it's our further understanding, although we don't have direct influence, is that Steward, its auditors and the
lender group is well on its way to successfully delivering that documentation.
 
Edward K. Aldag
Medical Properties Trust, Inc. - Founder, Chairman, President & CEO
Vikram, just on your second part of your question there. As you recall, on the Utah HCA transaction, Steward did not do a process. They
didn't have the property, those bigger hospitals up for sale. HCA came knocking on their door. But it's often the case when people learn
that somebody might be -- have an inside track to buying something. You can imagine that a lot of other people have called as well.
We're certainly not privy to those conversations and where they may be and any of that. But we certainly are aware of other people that
have an interest not only in the Utah facilities but some of the one-off facilities as well. But we don't have any direct knowledge of where
they may be in any of those discussions.
 
Vikram L. Malhotra
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division - MD
Okay. That's helpful. And then just on Prospect, obviously, you now included additional assets in that calculation of coverage. So we're
seeing the negative coverages there. But can you just help us understand all the sources of capital that Prospect has and kind of your
rent is current today? What's your confidence around that rent being current going forward?
 
Edward K. Aldag
Medical Properties Trust, Inc. - Founder, Chairman, President & CEO
So that's a good question. So we included Pennsylvania in the coverage this time. And it's important to note that the California facilities
continue to perform at acceptable levels. The Pennsylvania facilities are not where we would like them to be, certainly disappointed in
where they are. I think that the changes or some of the changes that Prospect has going on at Pennsylvania is certainly in the right
direction. Haven't borne the fruit that we certainly would hope that they would at this particular time. But remember, they've got the
managed care business, which is extremely profitable that generates strong cash flow for them.
And as Steve pointed out earlier, there are potential transactions out there that we're not in a position where we can comment any
further than that on that gives us comfort at this particular time. And we remain comfortable in the California facilities.
 
Vikram L. Malhotra
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division - MD
Okay. Great. And then just last one. Can you just clarify or provide us an update at this point where we are in the cycle, just look at what's
happening to hospitals broadly, the improvements you referenced. Do you anticipate a need to provide any additional loans to any of
your tenants?
 
Edward K. Aldag
Medical Properties Trust, Inc. - Founder, Chairman, President & CEO
So that's a good point about the hospitals and a point that sometimes we take for granted that we probably should spell out more.
Remember that these coverages that we present are on a trailing 12-month basis. So they'll look back. And on top of that, we report a
quarter in arrear. So this is really second quarter trailing 12-month information. So it includes 1 of the worst quarters that hospitals have
had in a very long time, the first quarter of this year. And as I pointed out in my prepared remarks, it includes a trailing off of the COVID
grant in some of those earlier parts of the 12 months.
So it's important to note that if you look at second quarter to third quarter, the preview, we don't have all of the numbers in from all of
our hospitals at this point, but what we've seen so far is that there is an improvement over the second quarter from first quarter and
there's also a continued improvement in hospitals in the months of June -- I'm sorry, July and August.
So we expect that to continue to improve. Just like most of the publicly reporting companies, our operators have made great strides with
their labor costs. And so we expect that to continue to improve as well. Their volumes are also up. Now obviously, August is always a
slow month in the hospital business. It seems to be the month that everybody takes vacation. So we'll see what the third quarter presents
just from that particular aspect. But we expect that all of the operators will see better continued going forward coverage.
We do not have any knowledge or needs -- foreseeable need that we would need to loan any money to any of our tenants for any rent
needs.
 
Operator
The next question comes from Jonathan Hughes from Raymond James.
 
Jonathan Hughes
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - Director & Senior Research Associate
I'd like to just focus on corporate governance. What steps has the Board taken beyond the announced dispositions and the stock buyback
plan given the dislocation and the heightened focus on the company this year? Have there been any changes to committee members or
plans to further refresh the Board? Has there been a special committee created to address the real-time concerns that have negatively
impacted the company all year? Have there been any discussions, actions taken to help improve communication and messaging to help
us in the investment community better understand MPT? I think a lot of people listening to this call definitely want to hear that the board
outside of you two and Steve is aware of what's going on and are taking steps to address these issues and govern the company.
 
Edward K. Aldag
Medical Properties Trust, Inc. - Founder, Chairman, President & CEO
Jonathan, as you probably note, there were changes to committee members and composition this year as is often the case in most years.
And then those were published following the annual meeting. We also added an additional Board member, as you know as well. Emily
Murphy joined our Board recently as well.
Our Board is very, very involved. We have a risk committee that meets on a regular basis that reviews all aspects of the company,
potential risk and obviously, current market conditions. The Board meets regularly, obviously, on a quarterly basis in person. We also
have very often phone call meetings and we go over everything in great detail. They are not only informed from Ed and Steve, but they're
also very informed from our outside advisors.
 
Jonathan Hughes
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - Director & Senior Research Associate
Okay. Yes, I didn't know about the changes. I don't think I knew about the committee changes earlier this year. I knew about the addition
to the Board. But I guess maybe going back to kind of communication and how the Board relays that to you and obviously us and the
investor community.
But with regards to Pipeline, we I think we all found out about that from Bloomberg and peers 8-K versus a filing for you. And I know it's
a small part of your portfolio, and you did talk about what's going on there in your prepared remarks, but that just seems like it would
have been an easy way to improve this communication that has been an issue among investors for years and then in your defense, it has
gotten better, but maybe going forward, could we expect a little bit more forthcoming and disclosure on those type of events if they do
happen in the future?
 
R. Steven Hamner
Medical Properties Trust, Inc. - Founder, Executive VP, CFO & Director
So Pipeline is a very small piece of our portfolio. Pipeline is fully paid cash rent, virtually all other obligations as of the end of the quarter,
which was when they filed for bankruptcy. We fully expect that this, again, relatively small relationship, will continue to pay rent, will
come out of bankruptcy either under current ownership or another ownership with our leases intact.
As of today, we have about $13 million in deposits and reserves on the Pipeline relationship. In addition, of course, as I say, to the -- what
we think is adequate assurance right now for continuing to get paid. And so I'm not sure how we would have reacted differently. We did
not have advance notice on Sunday night that they plan to file bankruptcy. So I just -- I'm not sure what we would have done differently,
frankly, once the news was out.
 
Jonathan Hughes
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - Director & Senior Research Associate
I mean maybe an 8-K or a press release would have been helpful, but I do understand that you didn't have any previous knowledge of it.
So that's a fair answer. I guess just 1 more for me then on capital allocation and external growth and dispositions. But how do you view
other avenues to create or prove value outside of monetizing real estate? Like with the Springstone operating company transaction in
August, is there any interest in packaging some of those OpCo investments with real estate in an effort to maybe create more incentive or
upside for potential partners? Or is it going to be more just a focus on looking at potential real estate deals?
 
R. Steven Hamner
Medical Properties Trust, Inc. - Founder, Executive VP, CFO & Director
The Springstone transaction, that whole series of transactions going back 18 months now is just a really, really good example of how we
use our RIDEA-type investment. Springstone was a platform, a well-developed, well-managed, private equity-owned platform that was
developed over many years. And even though it was developed over many years, the real estate was relatively newly developed,
state-of-the-art behavioral hospitals. It was 18 hospitals worth about $750 million that we have had our eyes on for many years, frankly.
In order to capture that very attractive real estate, which is now already grown as we thought it would, as Springstone continues to grow
its business across the country. In order to capture that, when the private equity firm was ready to exit like most private equity firms and
like several other transactions I could describe with similar examples, the seller was not willing to bifurcate real estate and OpCo, and
make 2 separate sales. So in order for us to capture the real estate, which is what we wanted, and which was 75% or 80% of the total
value, we had to be willing and capable frankly, of acquiring the whole company, and that's what we did a little over a year ago.
And even before we closed that transaction, we have multiple parties interested and approaching us in acquiring the OpCo, which, while
we are absolutely capable of managing along with our management team partner. That's not our business. That's not what we want to
do long term. And so within 6 months, we had agreed with Apollo and LifePoint for them to acquire a majority interest in the operating
platform for a very significant gain on our part. And now we have or we will have presuming closing that's expected, but certainly not
guaranteed early in 2023, now we will have what we wanted from the beginning, which is a very, very good portfolio of well developed,
specifically behavioral health care real estate.
So I think it worked out. Again, I know it worked out very, very attractively for us. We are proud that we've developed the skill to
underwrite operating companies, because it gives us a tremendous competitive advantage, when we do have opportunities to look at
companies that are for sale, the total enterprise is for sale and there's a significant portion of real estate. And again, I won't go through it
all in detail, but this is what we did with Ernest very, very profitably over a 5- or 6-year hold period. We did it with a similarly short hold
period with Capella back in 2015.
And on smaller scales, we've captured significant gains on our equity interest, for example, in MEDIAN, in ATOS, two German platforms
that we have and again on smaller scales and others.
So Springstone worked out exactly like we like it to work out, and we would hope that it would work out like that in the future on
additional transactions. Sorry, I went kind of long-winded on that.
 
Jonathan Hughes
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division - Director & Senior Research Associate
That's fine. I mean I understand the Springstone rationale and totally get -- I guess my question more so would you look at potentially
selling part of your equity stake in Steward OpCo with real estate to get a deal done. I realize you own 10% of Steward today, sell 5% or
so and package that with real estate. Is that something that could be considered?
 
R. Steven Hamner
Medical Properties Trust, Inc. - Founder, Executive VP, CFO & Director
Well, that's not an unfair observation, I think, because there is a level -- a high level of interest. You already saw it, of course, with
Macquarie earlier this year on the Massachusetts portfolio. There's a similar level of interest from other infrastructure and other funds
that may be willing actually to consider something that you've just described. I don't -- again, we don't have anything to announce or
even hint at this morning, but it's not an unfair observation, Jon.

The next question comes from Michael Carroll from RBC Capital Markets.
 
Michael Albert Carroll
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - Analyst
Steve, regarding the potential Prospect deals that you kind of highlighted in your prepared remarks and I know you don't want to provide
too many details on that, but can you highlight the potential timing of those transactions? I mean how far along are those discussions?
And does the changing interest rate environment put those deals at risk at all?
 
R. Steven Hamner
Medical Properties Trust, Inc. - Founder, Executive VP, CFO & Director
Well, that's a very good question also. Mike, I think anything that depends today on a high level of debt, any type of transaction, I don't
think anybody should assert any certainty maybe with the exception tomorrow of the Twitter thing. It looks like it will get done. But
leverage lending right now is pretty volatile. And while you're right, it's not that I don't want to comment, it's really -- we're just legally
prohibited from comment just as a general observation. The capital markets, including maybe even especially the leverage lending
market is particularly volatile in our view right now.
 
Michael Albert Carroll
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - Analyst
Okay. Does the changing in the interest rate environment, does that impact those potential deals? Or you just can't comment on that
right now?
 
R. Steven Hamner
Medical Properties Trust, Inc. - Founder, Executive VP, CFO & Director
We just can't comment on it right now.
 
Michael Albert Carroll
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - Analyst
Okay. And then with regard to the sale, the Connecticut sale of Yale, I guess, what type of regulatory hurdles still needs to be clear there.
Is there any concern that there's risks to that?
 
R. Steven Hamner
Medical Properties Trust, Inc. - Founder, Executive VP, CFO & Director
Well, there is risk to that. There's no question there's risk to that anytime you have the regulators involved. Primarily, the biggest hurdle is
the transaction does require a certificate of need approval. Now given the circumstances, given the financial, the political, the other
influence and power, and benefits of bringing Yale to these hospitals, 1 would think that the regulators would prefer to see Yale come in
and stabilize these facilities. And so again, 1 would think maybe the risk is mitigated, but that is the risk. And we do understand that it's
not going to be an overnight decision.
 
Michael Albert Carroll
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - Analyst
Okay. Great. And then just last 1 for me. I know you kind of highlighted that there are several, I guess, portfolios that you're looking to sell
within your portfolio currently. And I know that there is reports that MPW might be willing to sell the Healthscope properties not sure if
you could provide any color on potential transactions outside of what's already announced. But maybe can you provide some color on
private market valuations and how those have been impacted by the current interest rate? I mean, is it reasonable to expect that you can
get some of those larger transactions completed in the current environment?
 
R. Steven Hamner
Medical Properties Trust, Inc. - Founder, Executive VP, CFO & Director
Well, we think so. That's a really interesting answer to your interesting question, because as I just made the comment that the debt
capital markets pretty volatile. There are investors, primarily sovereigns, pension funds and others, who are still assessing a pretty
attractive, at least preliminarily based on what we see in the market, pretty attractive cap rates on well underwritten hospital real estate.
And so while we shouldn't kid ourselves that interest rates were up a couple of hundred basis points, then that's not going to affect
pricing. It's not affecting our early indications as much as if we were trying to sell to a private equity firm, for example. So it's not a very
clear answer, I understand, other than to say that there's still a high level of infrastructure-like cash flows that have the kind of inflation
protection that many hospital leases have.

The next question comes from John Pawlowski from Green Street.
 
John Joseph Pawlowski
Green Street Advisors, LLC, Research Division - MD of Residential and Health Care
Ed, I may have missed the number in the beginning, but can you just let us know what's driving the difference between what sounds like
a $350 million EBITDAR projection for Steward next year versus the $800 million run rate disclosed last quarter?
 
Edward K. Aldag
Medical Properties Trust, Inc. - Founder, Chairman, President & CEO
Well, the $800 million is an EBITDAR number and the $350 million is an EBITDA number.
 
John Joseph Pawlowski
Green Street Advisors, LLC, Research Division - MD of Residential and Health Care
Okay. And then could you -- but then could you share kind of how you bridge the, I guess, $50 million to $80 million EBITDA figure for
'22 up to the $350 million for next year?
 
Edward K. Aldag
Medical Properties Trust, Inc. - Founder, Chairman, President & CEO
Going from what we -- the projections of the fiscal year this year being the $50 million to $80 million to the $350 million next year, is
that the question?
 
John Joseph Pawlowski
Green Street Advisors, LLC, Research Division - MD of Residential and Health Care
Yes, how to get there.
 
Edward K. Aldag
Medical Properties Trust, Inc. - Founder, Chairman, President & CEO
Most of that is continued improvement in the operations, but the biggest number of that is the full effect of the cost savings that will be
in effect in '23.
 
John Joseph Pawlowski
Green Street Advisors, LLC, Research Division - MD of Residential and Health Care
Okay. Final question for me. Could you just give us a sense just in terms of your broader -- just all your hospitals, what percentage
roughly in order of magnitude, what percentage of CapEx projects have been deferred in the last few years as hospitals have had bigger
priorities and just strains on liquidity? I'm just trying to get a sense for the wave of deferred CapEx that we could expect over the next few
years.
 
Edward K. Aldag
Medical Properties Trust, Inc. - Founder, Chairman, President & CEO
So John, I suppose you're talking about the CapEx that is funded directly by our operators, not the capital additions that we fund. And if
that is the right question, I've been doing this for almost 38 years, and it has been a nice thing to see that hospitals generally do a very
good job of keeping their hospital CapEx up to date. If they don't, then they certainly will see declines in their operations.
To date, we do not have any facilities that we have seen substantial material deferments of CapEx. And we have teams here in the
company that go out to every single property every year and review each 1 of those specific aspects for every property.
 
R. Steven Hamner
Medical Properties Trust, Inc. - Founder, Executive VP, CFO & Director
I'll just add a final comment on that. John, particularly in Europe and even in Australia, because of the nature of the reimbursement,
which comes from employers and employer-related pension funds, our facilities are inspected frequently by these reimbursement payers,
specifically for quality of the physical plant for the capital expenditures. And as Ed just alluded to, if they're not totally up to date, then
revenue reimbursement is penalized. So it does no good for a hospital, even if they were so inclined in those circumstances to cut back on
CapEx.
 
Operator
The next question comes from Steven Valiquette from Barclays.
 
Steven James Valiquette
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Research Analyst
So a couple of questions here in related on Steward. First, my understanding was that another use of cash within Steward over the past
year was capital expenditures on the Florida hospitals that Steward acquired from Tenet Healthcare. So I'm wondering if the payoff on
those investments is a big part of the expected EBITDA improvement at Steward in '23 versus '22. And at those kind of really tying to my
bigger question is, with that EBITDA projected to be $50 million to $80 million for Steward this year, then going to $350 million next
year. When you think about that just in the context of the breakdown of the Steward facilities geographically that you guys always show
on Page 11 of your supplement between Utah, Florida, Texas, Arizona, et cetera. Are you able to discuss just at a very high level, which of
those geographies may have the biggest improvement year-over-year? So just thinking about it geographically as well might be helpful.
 
Edward K. Aldag
Medical Properties Trust, Inc. - Founder, Chairman, President & CEO
Yes. I think without a doubt, the biggest improvement is indeed Florida. Florida is way exceeding our original underwriting expectations.
It may even be exceeding Steward's. I don't know for a fact, but I do know that those particular facilities have done exceptionally well. But
all of all of their markets continue to perform well. There's the Ohio, Pennsylvania area that is probably the least performing, but none of
them are negative. They all are performing very well.
 
Operator
The next question comes from Mike Muller from JPMorgan.
 
Michael Muller
I have 2 questions, and I just want to check the math. So first, can you break down this $650 million of proceeds that you're expecting for
next year, along with the blended yield? And then second, can you talk about the different geographies where you see your 10-year
financing rates at this point? And then the math I wanted to check was, if Steward's expecting $350 million of EBITDA next year, I think
your cash rent payments are around $375 million. So does that imply about a 1.9x coverage?
 
Edward K. Aldag
Medical Properties Trust, Inc. - Founder, Chairman, President & CEO
So the quick answer to that last question is yes.
 
Michael Muller
Okay, great.
 
R. Steven Hamner
Medical Properties Trust, Inc. - Founder, Executive VP, CFO & Director
The quick answer to the first question is the $650 million is comprised of an estimated $200 million that we expect to receive in first half
of 2023 from proceeds for the Springstone transaction and then roughly another $450 million from the Yale transaction and that
comprises the $650 million. And I'm sorry, I forgot the middle question.
 
Michael Muller
6 Yes. Just financing rates in the different geographies.
 
R. Steven Hamner
Medical Properties Trust, Inc. - Founder, Executive VP, CFO & Director
Yes. High and extraordinarily high in a couple of cases, primarily the U.K., where you've just seen and kind of an incredible social political
situation that spiked interest rates and currency transactions. But just order of magnitude, Mike, if we're talking about the U.S. where the
last issuance we did was 3 years ago, that we issued 10-year unsecured at 3.5%. I think we would feel very fortunate if we had to do that
today, which, of course, we do not. But if we issue 10-year U.S. dollars today, it's probably going to be 8-plus percent.
 
Michael Muller
Okay. Any similar commentary on euros, pounds, Australia?
 
R. Steven Hamner
Medical Properties Trust, Inc. - Founder, Executive VP, CFO & Director
Well, we certainly don't have any plans, especially in Australia. Remember, the only debt we have down there, it's Australian dollar debt
is the term loan that we borrowed from the banks in order to buy Healthscope 3 years ago. That still has 2 years left on it. And so we --
and that's a very, very attractive transaction that we did. We are well, well into the money on the swap that we executed for that loan.
On the U.K., which is our earliest maturity in a little over a year, I think it's December of 2023. That was a relatively short-term issue and I
don't know what that would be today even. But my guess and maybe it's a bit of a hope is, again, because of the political situation in the
U.K., that rate will come back to something more normalized, which nonetheless would be much higher than that I think we're paying
about 2.5% on that right now.
 
Operator
the next question comes from Joshua Dennerlein from Bank of America.
 
Joshua Dennerlein
BofA Securities, Research Division - VP
You commented in the press release you expect rent growth of 4% to 5% next year. How does that compare to potential rate increases
for your operators like that they might be getting from the payers?
 
Edward K. Aldag
Medical Properties Trust, Inc. - Founder, Chairman, President & CEO
So, that's a great question. Obviously, CMS has already announced what their rate increase will be. I think it was 4.5% in that range. Very
interestingly, we've just recently learned that Germany is going to be somewhere in the neighborhood of 6%, I believe. And so you're
seeing those types of rates on a go-forward basis.
 
R. Steven Hamner
Medical Properties Trust, Inc. - Founder, Executive VP, CFO & Director
I think the conceptual thing to remember, Josh, is with respect to rents, to the landlord rents, especially on acute care hospitals, it's a
relatively small piece of net revenue, generally around 5%. So when it comes to inflation pressures, hospitals aren't focused on paying a
little bit higher rent on 5%. They're certainly much more focused, as I described a little earlier on, getting down the inflationary
escalations on salaries, wages and benefits and other supply chain issues.
And then again, over time, going all the way back to when records first started being kept for Medicare, over time, which doesn't mean
from quarter-to-quarter, obviously, but revenue reimbursement has always kept up and in fact, exceeded inflation.
 
Joshua Dennerlein
BofA Securities, Research Division - VP
Can you maybe walk us through that a bit more, like what kind of lag there is with the payers and inflationary pressures? And are there
certain times of year where we should look for announcements from the payers?
 
Edward K. Aldag
Medical Properties Trust, Inc. - Founder, Chairman, President & CEO
So CMS is every year. And then the commercial insurance payers will vary, because people enter into contracts that vary in length from 1
year to 3 years, and it's different for every single 1 of their payers. Some states like Alabama only has 1 basically commercial insurer, but
states like Texas have a lot. So you'll have hospital operators having 50% -- 40% to 50% of their revenue coming from a lot of different
commercial insurers, and those are being negotiated all throughout the year.
 
Operator
The next question comes from Tayo Okusanya from Credit Suisse.
 
Omotayo Tejamude Okusanya
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division - Analyst
Just a couple of quick ones on Steward. First of all -- and I may have missed it because I did get on the call a little late, but the delay in
the Texas development to -- by about 1.5 years. Could you just talk a little bit about how that decision was made? And also noticed that
Steward rents were kind of down this quarter from like to $117 million from $125 million before. Just curious if you could help us reconcile
that difference.
 
R. Steven Hamner
Medical Properties Trust, Inc. - Founder, Executive VP, CFO & Director
So Steward commenced active predevelopment for the Wadley Hospital about this time last year, sometime in mid- to late 2021. And
then later that year, MPT made an initial advance funding. And then in 2022, Steward accelerated, trying to line up and prefund or at
least pre-identify in recognition of supply constraints, materials cost and lining up contractors and general contractors. Anyway, that was
the process through 2022, the early part of 2022, at which time Steward decided to change the general contractor.
And so that change disrupted the timing and it's our understanding that we're very close to new agreements with a new general
contractor and construction will restart late this year or very early next.
 
Omotayo Tejamude Okusanya
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division - Analyst
Okay. That's helpful. And then the lower rent, the difference?
 
R. Steven Hamner
Medical Properties Trust, Inc. - Founder, Executive VP, CFO & Director
So remember a few years ago, the auditing rules makers made us recognize as an MPT expense -- let's just say, for example, we paid an
insurance premium, sometimes insurance premiums and frankly, in this case, are very large on an annual basis, say, $7 million. We have
to recognize that even though we turn around and the next day or the very same day, we collect a check back from the tenants, because
tenants, of course, under triple net lease are responsible for paying insurance. So there's a timing issue that you're referring to in
recognition of an MPT expense in 1 period and then in the same or a different period of the next year, you'll see that expenses turned
around into income or vice versa.
 
Omotayo Tejamude Okusanya
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division - Analyst
Got you. That's helpful. And then last 1 for me. The big change in the straight-line rents as well during the quarter. Just kind of help us
better understand what created that.
 
R. Steven Hamner
Medical Properties Trust, Inc. - Founder, Executive VP, CFO & Director
Well, the biggest issue on straight-line rent was just writing off the accrued straight-line rent with respect to those Prime assets.
Remember, we sold $360-plus million of Prime assets, which had been accruing straight-line rent for many years. And so that's just a
noncash write-off.

Our last question is a follow-up from Steven Valiquette.
 
Steven James Valiquette
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Research Analyst
Just 1 quick clarification question. I think on Steward, you mentioned it was roughly $50 million of EBITDA in 2Q and you said it was
expected to be $30 million or maybe $30 million plus in the third quarter. I wasn't sure if that was for the full third quarter or just
quarter-to-date or something like that or maybe a couple of months, but also if that is the full quarter, maybe just any quick color on why
that was sort of stepping down sequentially, if I heard those numbers correct.
 
Edward K. Aldag
Medical Properties Trust, Inc. - Founder, Chairman, President & CEO
It is for the full quarter, Steven, and I don't have the detail on why the step down.
 
Steven James Valiquette
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Research Analyst
Okay. So we could follow up maybe offline later on that.
 
Edward K. Aldag
