Craig Benigno;Senior Analyst Investor Relations
Good morning, and thank you for joining us for RPT's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, management would like
me to inform you that certain statements made during this conference call, which are not historical may be deemed forward-looking
statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Additionally, statements made during the call are
made as of the date of this call. Listeners to any replay should understand that the passage of time by itself will diminish the quality of
the statements made.
Although we believe that the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, factors
and risks could cause actual results to differ from expectations. Certain of these factors are described as risk factors in our annual report

Certain of these statements made on today's call also involve non-GAAP financial measures. Listeners are directed to our third quarter
2022 press release, which includes definitions of those non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the nearest GAAP measures and
which are available on our website in the Investors section.
I would now like to turn the call over to President and CEO, Brian Harper; and CFO, Mike Fitzmaurice, for their opening remarks. After
which, we will open the call for questions.
 
Brian L. Harper
RPT Realty - President, CEO & Trustee
Thanks, Craig. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call today. We are happy to report another solid quarter across all elements
of our business. Overall, we are operating from a position of strength. Our capital recycling efforts for the year are now complete. We
have closed on about $225 million of acquisitions located primarily in Boston and Miami that were funded at a largely leverage and
earnings neutral basis with asset sales in Chicago, Detroit and Columbus.
The balance sheet is in great shape. Today, we have no debt maturing until 2025, roughly 95% of our debt is fixed and we have a clear
pathway to leverage in the low 6s as our signed not open, or SNO, commences. Our SNO balance jumped 60% since last quarter to a
record high of $14 million, led by another strong quarter of leasing volume that pushed our lease rate to 94%. SNO represents about 8%
of annualized third quarter NOI, giving us strong visibility on healthy organic growth into 2023 and beyond.
In the quarter, we closed on the transformational acquisition of Mary Brickell Village in the heart of downtown Miami. We have been
actively integrating this asset into our portfolio through our in-house design studio as well as with Gensler, a leading architectural firm.
We have developed placemaking and modernization plans that will help drive our significant mark-to-market opportunity at MBV.
Today, we are thrilled with the tenant demand at this asset and are experiencing unsolicited strong interest from world-class operators.
Recent lease comps are over 50% above our underwriting, and we are currently in negotiations with several first-to-market tenants at
rents in the $130 per square foot range. As a result, we are being extremely measured in how we strategically curate the ideal mix of
tenancy. Our goal is to deliver the best possible customer experience that results in optimal foot traffic, sales productivity and rents.
Longer term, Gensler is also helping us envision the future at Mary Brickell, which will include significant densification. Our site is zoned
for up to 4.1 million square feet of residential, office or hotel use, which gives us great optionality for future value creation. Simply put,
Mary Brickell is stronger and has significantly more upside than we originally thought.
Turning to our value-enhancing remerchandising, redevelopment and outlet expansion pipeline. Today, we have roughly 14 active
projects totaling $57 million that are expected to generate a weighted average return on cost of about 10%. Due to the demand at our
centers and our hands-on asset management approach, this set of opportunities has increased from effectively zero at year-end 2020.
Last week, we closed on the contributions of 2 Midwest assets into the grocery-anchored joint venture. These sales provided earnings
neutral funding for Mary Brickell after factoring in management fees and signed leases scheduled to open next year. This is on the heels
of selling 2 assets located in Chicago and Detroit during the third quarter. Before turning the call over to Mike, I wanted to provide some
additional color on 2 retailers that have been in the news as of late. That's Regal and Bed Bath & Beyond.
We have a proven track record of proactively recapturing space and releasing to higher-quality tenants at double-digit returns. These
opportunities are no different. We are playing offense given the robust demand at our centers, and the leasing team is firing on all
cylinders. At the end of the quarter, we had 3 leases with Regal that are paying us $25 per square foot and account for 2.4% of ABR. All 3
are freestanding, making them easier to backfill or repurpose if needed.
By way of example, during the third quarter, we proactively recaptured a Regal at River City Marketplace in Jacksonville that we released
to BJ's Wholesale Club. Not only will this trade significantly improve the credit of the asset when the BJ lease starts in early '24, but it will
also more than double the cash flow we are getting from Regal. Additionally, we expect cap rate compression for the overall center given
the upgrade in tenancy.
This is a great example of how the pandemic created an opportunity for us as we were able to obtain a recapture rate as part of our
deferral negotiations with Regal. Our remaining locations are at Deerfield Towne Center in Cincinnati, Providence Marketplace in
Nashville and The Crossings in Boston with expirations in '26 and '27. Each of our remaining Regals are strong performers that are well
situated within their respective markets and have experienced strong improvements in traffic since 2020 and year-over-year. In the case
of The Crossings, the closest national theater is over 35 miles away.
Regarding Bed Bath, we have 8 Bed Bath and 4 buybuy BABY stores in the portfolio that account for 2.4% of our ABR. Our stores have a
low average ABR per square foot of $11.59, which is about the lowest rent amongst our peers. We believe replacement rents would be in
the mid-teens, providing a strong mark-to-market opportunity.
We have seen good demand for each of our locations from a wide range of tenant types, including grocers, discount apparel, home
furnishings and sporting goods. Given the overall supply demand imbalance for high-quality retail real estate in strong markets and our
below average in-place rents, we see this as an opportunity to drive earnings and improve tenant quality over time. With that, I'll turn the
call over to Mike.
 
Michael P. Fitzmaurice
RPT Realty - Executive VP & CFO
Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Our balance sheet is in great shape and puts us on strong footing to thrive in today's
environment. Liquidity is high, and we expect it to be about $475 million at the end of the year. Liabilities are low as we have no debt
maturing until 2025. Leverage is getting better. We've ticked down to 7.0x this quarter.
Including our SNO balance of $14 million, this week's revolver paydown of $80 million and undrawn forward equity of $16 million, our net
debt to adjusted EBITDA would be 6.0x. This puts us squarely at the midpoint of our long-term range. And lastly, today, we only have
roughly 5% floating rate debt, limiting our downside risk to a rising rate environment.
Financial results are coming in just above plan. Operating FFO per diluted share of $0.27 was flat versus last quarter despite the outsized
bad debt expense related to Regal's bankruptcy filing in September. Of the $576,000 of bad debt that we recognized during the quarter,
$557,000 was due to Regal. Of note, same-property NOI was 1.6% for the quarter, putting us at 5.4% year-to-date.
We continue to opportunistically take advantage of the strong leasing environment. We signed 85 leases totaling about 700,000 square
feet in the quarter. This brings our year-to-date leasing volume to 1.7 million square feet, putting us on track to hit our highest yearly
leasing volume since 2014. We generated renewal lease spreads of 8.5% and 7.0% during the third quarter 2022 and on a trailing
12-month basis, respectively.
These spreads demonstrate that a limited supply of new retail construction over the last several years is allowing us to drive rent on
renewed deals with less CapEx and no downtime. Absent the purposeful recapture of spaces that we expect to remerchandise, our
retention rate for 2022 is expected to be about 88%, well above historical rates. The robust leasing activity drove our signed not
commenced balance $14 million, an increase of $5.2 million or 60% over last quarter.
To be clear, our SNO represents rent and recovery income for spaces that are currently vacant. Over 50% of this record level SNO comes
from essential tenants as well as leases with best-in-class retailers such as Sierra Trading company, Burlington, BJ's Wholesale Club,
Publix, Giant/Ahold, Sephora and Ferguson Gallery. Our SNO backlog will provide earnings tailwind through 2025 with a total
incremental benefit to operating FFO expected to be about $0.15 per share, up from $0.09 per share last quarter.
We expect $0.01 to come online in the fourth quarter of 2022, $0.08 in 2023, $0.05 in 2024 and $0.01 in 2025. Our leasing success
resulted in a sequential uptick in our lease rate to 94%, up 70 basis points and 150 basis points year-over-year. This pushed our leased
occupied spread to 510 basis points, the widest spread since we began tracking the stat.
Our occupancy did tick lower this quarter due in large part to the proactive recapture of 2 anchor spaces: Regal at River City Marketplace
and Pottery Barn outlet at Northborough Crossing, which have already been released to BJ's Wholesale Club, Marshalls and
HomeGoods. These proactive and planned recaptures reflect our long-term mindset of improving sustainable cash flow, credit quality
and merchandising mix.
Turning to guidance. Given the better-than-expected performance in the quarter, we are raising our operating FFO per share guidance to
$1.02 to $1.05, up from $1.01 to $1.05, a $0.005 increase at the midpoint. Additionally, we are raising our same-property NOI growth
assumption range to 3.75% to 4.25%, a 50 basis point increase at the midpoint.
We do expect operating FFO to decelerate in the fourth quarter due to previously discussed asset sales in Detroit and Columbus. Also,
our incentive compensation is not finalized until the fourth quarter, which could result in an uptick in G&A expense in the fourth quarter,
similar to what we experienced in 2021. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator to open the line for questions.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 
Operator
(Operator Instructions) We have a first question from the line of Derek Johnston with Deutsche Bank.
 
Derek Charles Johnston
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Research Analyst
Just wondering how Mary Brickell is tracking versus the initial underwriting versus the initial plan. You do still have some vacancy there.
So besides that, what type of merchandising mix or what does the center need in your opinion?
 
Brian L. Harper
RPT Realty - President, CEO & Trustee
Yes. Thanks, Derek. With Mary Brickell, we knew we had something special when we bought the asset. And as I said in my prepared
remarks, now our opinion is even much greater. I think it's -- pointed out is, given the zero supply of space in the Brickell market, which is
considered one of the hottest submarkets in the country, the demand is astonishing.
The sales coming from this trade area rival both Manhattan and Vegas. Food and beverage alone in Brickell does $0.5 billion in sales,
and international American retailers want a presence in this submarket. Brickell, really in the last 2 years, has now a desired location
similar to areas such as Design District and Aventura, and we see that even improving.
We need to keep in mind that the center is only 200,000 square feet. So this, coupled with the zero supply of space, the top-tier sales
and -- it allows for extremely favorable pricing power for landlords. In my prepared remarks, I mentioned $130 triple net for rent. We see
this even gaining higher when we proactively recapture the space. As tenants expire, we will see significant mark-to-market in this $45
ABR center.
Right now, we're really laser-focused, Derek, on like the design phase 1 with Gensler and the placemaking of the center, and we are
negotiating a few deals with first to market, even really first to U.S. concepts. To say the least, this center will deliver significant NAV for
our shareholders even prior to any densification. And just really to sum this up, we see this as double-digit unlevered returns before we
go vertical. So it is much stronger than any of us thought when we underwrote this at $76 a square foot.
 
Derek Charles Johnston
Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Research Analyst
Got it. That's helpful. And just a little bit on the private markets, certainly, transaction volumes have really fallen off a cliff here. You guys
were very active this year intelligently to do it at front-loading, clearly. But what can you tell us about private markets right now, the
bid-ask between buyers and sellers? And I thought it was interesting that you said you're most likely done for the year, but any color
there is really appreciated.
 
Brian L. Harper
RPT Realty - President, CEO & Trustee
Yes. I mean I think this is a wait-and-see approach at sellers and owners -- sellers and buyers looking at each other and who blinks first.
It's a pricing discovery. I think the smaller, more tangible, maybe grocery or core power urban infill, call that 50 bps of widening. The rest
is too early to tell. But we're sitting and observing right now and really focusing on firing on all cylinders on the operational front, just
given the large SNO pipeline that we anticipate even growing even further.
 
Operator
We have next question from the line of Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
 
Todd Michael Thomas
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division - MD & Senior Equity Research Analyst
First question, I guess, Mike, on guidance. So the revised guidance implies fourth quarter OFFO of, I think, $0.235, that compares to
$0.27 this quarter. You talked about incentive comp, some of the asset sales or dispositions or contributions. Can you just provide a little
bit more color, I guess, on the step down that you're expecting from $0.27 to $0.235 at the midpoint? And also, any considerations
around 2023 that we should be thinking about for the model?
 
Michael P. Fitzmaurice
RPT Realty - Executive VP & CFO
Sure. I think you hit it right on the head. It's really those 2 elements that are causing the deceleration into the fourth quarter. It's about
$0.02, Todd, from the sale of Shops on Lane and Troy, plus about [a half quarter] from the sales we did in the third quarter -- second
quarter, sorry, with Mount Prospect and a few more assets in the Midwest part of the country. And then another $0.02 is going to come
from G&A. So that really kind of bridges you from the $0.27 to the $0.23.
And as you think about next year, I mean, at this point in the year, especially in today's environment, there are some knowns and
unknowns. The biggest known for us, the least amount of risk is our signed not commenced backlog, about $14 million, which is expected
to contribute about $0.08 next year, about $0.03 in the first half of 2023, and $0.05 in the second half. If you layer on that our implied
fourth quarter run rate of about $0.23, that puts you right at $1 and that's a good place to start. And there'll be puts and takes from
there, which will offer more clarity on our February call in 2023.
 
Todd Michael Thomas
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division - MD & Senior Equity Research Analyst
Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe we could just shift to the leasing environment a little bit. Brian, I'm curious if you're seeing any
change at all, any let down in tenant demand or in the conversations that you're having. And then sizable increase in the SNO pipeline
that you talked about. Can you talk about, I guess, the leasing pipeline for what's in advanced negotiations, what's behind that SNO
pipeline, whether you feel that you can continue to build that leasing backlog from here as economic occupancy continues to improve?
 
Brian L. Harper
RPT Realty - President, CEO & Trustee
Yes. Let me tackle the demand. It is as robust as I've ever seen in my career. And I think that comes down to a few things. One, supply
and demand. Currently, there's virtually no new supply, which is incredibly supportive for landlords with Class A product, which we have.
Two, retailers are much healthier going into this recession. Our portfolio is much stronger than before, just given the geography changes.
I mean we've sold 1/3 of our portfolio. We now hold core holdings in cities like Boston, Miami, Tampa and Atlanta. A lot of this in that
SNO, 62% of our SNO bucket is in Florida and Boston. Another 10% is actually in Detroit, which we have Class A product there. And like
the final point on just demand, it comes down to occupancy costs. And having a low ABR portfolio like us, I mean, that really helps us
drive the leading -- sector-leading spreads, which we've done since we've been here, in any environment, in the good times and in any
recessionary environment.
So I very feel there's been no select slowdown. We've been signing leases even yesterday. The demand for future called the shadow. We
are in advanced lease negotiations with several grocers and even home improvement. So it's as robust as our SNO schedule. So we feel
very good going into '23. And certainly, a lot of this is going to hit end of '23 and well into '24.
 
Michael P. Fitzmaurice
RPT Realty - Executive VP & CFO
And Todd, a few things I would add there. I mean, today, we're 94% leased, and we think we can get this portfolio to 95%, 96%, which
represents another couple of percent of leasing, which is about $4 million to $5 million. $2 million, to Brian's point, we are in active
negotiations on the legal front or in LOI. So we're about almost halfway to that 95%, 96% goal. And a lot of that's going to come from a
small shop. I mean today, our anchor lease rate is about 96.7%, so we got a little bit of opportunity there to get that closer to 98%.
But really, it's the small shop. And today, we leased it at 87.2%, and just to kind of give you some math on what that opportunity looks
like, for every 1% increase in that rate equates to about $875,000 in rent, which is about $0.01. So it's pretty material to our portfolio.
And then the trifecta effect you get from small shop is the higher ABR per square foot. You get the better escalators of 3% to 4%, and you
also get a higher recovery rate on those expenses. So we're pretty excited about the opportunity ahead of us.
 
Operator
We have next question from the line of Wes Golladay with Baird.
 
Wesley Keith Golladay
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst
I just want to look at this very highly uncertain economic backdrop. Does this change how you're going to approach leasing? I get that it's
really strong on the ground that you're seeing but there is some deterioration going on in the background that may not show up until
probably next year. I'm just wondering if you're going to -- when you do these leases, are you pulling back from any categories? Or are
you saying, hey, let's just target the best risk adjusted returns, which maybe Mary Brickell Village? Any change in the leasing dynamics
over the last few quarters?
 
Brian L. Harper
RPT Realty - President, CEO & Trustee
Sure. I mean we've always been laser-focused on credit, especially IG credit. And when you look at a lot of the SNO, whether that's the
lululemons of the world to the T.J. Maxxes to the Publix to the Aholds, we're very focused on that. So I mean, Wes, I look at this leasing
and I look at where I can get the highest return possible. Small shop leasing in our SNO, we roughly average 40% return on cost.
Our anchor deals in the SNO roughly average 15% return on cost. That's a total of 20% return on cost. That, coupled with our redev
remerchandising at a 10%, that's a good business. And so we have a team just analyzing the credits of all of these retailers of which we're
doing the leases with, and so we're very, very focused. And there will be more scrutiny, certainly. But right now, we're all focused on
operation and our organic growth.
 
Wesley Keith Golladay
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst
Got it. And then when you look at recapture, that's been a big part of the story this year. You got ahead of some of the bad credits. Would
you look to continue recapturing? Or are you just now going to wait for these things to naturally come together?
 
Brian L. Harper
RPT Realty - President, CEO & Trustee
Yes. I think we're -- we play active asset management, almost like we are hands-on, boots on the ground, looking at space by space
biweekly with a CRM program that rolls up to me the status of the local tenants, the status of the regional tenants, the status of -- I
mean, we have knowledge in every space.
So whether it's your boxes or whether it's small shop, we have a general idea of how well they're performing. And our goal as landlords is
to recapture and drive a merchandising mix that effectuates higher sales but also grows cash flow. And if there's an opportunity to
recapture, call it, a Bed Bath proactively and replace with a grocer, replace with a TJX concept, replace with a Total Wine, that's
something we'll look at.
 
Michael P. Fitzmaurice
RPT Realty - Executive VP & CFO
Yes. And generally, we will be -- won't make these decisions until we have a bird in hand. I mean look no further than what we did here in
2020. Two, we took back about 300,000 square feet of space this year from a purposeful perspective. And that's already been all leased.
And we're talking about Giant/Ahold. We're talking about Publix. We're talking about Sierra, Marshalls, HomeGoods, BJ's Wholesale. So
that's the recipe, and we're going to continue that if it makes sense as Brian noted.
 
Brian L. Harper
RPT Realty - President, CEO & Trustee
I mean in summary, Wes, we're on offense on leasing.
 
Wesley Keith Golladay
Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division - Senior Research Analyst
Okay. Yes. And I guess a bigger picture question on that. Is it just easier now to recapture? Are they harder to negotiate? You have to pay
less now that you know that these -- some companies are clearly saying, we're going to shut down stores. You may be actually helping
them out a little bit to shrink their footprint. So I just wonder if it's monetarily a little bit...
 
Brian L. Harper
RPT Realty - President, CEO & Trustee
It's never easier. Some of the tenants -- I wish it was easier, to be honest. But I think a couple of things. It's always good where the tenant
-- you can double dip and maybe write you a check to get out, where we have a tenant lease in hand on the other. And two, it's very few
tenants in our cash flows, who are having issues. So we actually, I would say, 90% of the time try to recapture space and get turned
down. So this will be selective. This will be with precision, and this will be using the highest return that we can get, given CapEx is fragile.
 
Operator
We have next question from the line of Linda Tsai with Jefferies.
 
Linda Tsai
Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst
Given the 88% retention ratio, you're at 94% occupancy. Do you think you could get to 95% by year-end '23?
 
Michael P. Fitzmaurice
RPT Realty - Executive VP & CFO
Look, I think it's too early to tell on the occupancy front. From a lease perspective, I think there's a shot. But like I was talking to in a
discussion with Todd, I think there's some knowns right now and there's some unknowns. The most -- the best known item for us right
now is that signed not commenced, which is going to absolutely grow our occupancy. And as Brian and I both commented on, we have
several million of leases in negotiation so that should continue to push that leased rate.
 
Brian L. Harper
RPT Realty - President, CEO & Trustee
And I think a couple of things, Linda, too. If you look at our supplemental, you specifically look at Delray and Broward. These deals are
60% and 70% leased. We have a market-leading share grocer for both. These are $17 ABR centers that we see growing to mid-30s, so
really 2 special pieces of real estate that are currently low occupancy that you'll see a big increase in that leased occupancy here in the
short term.
 
Linda Tsai
Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst
Got it. And then it sounds like that $14 million SNO pipeline really creates a healthy cushion. So against that kind of background, how do
you think about bad debt for '23? And would you create a reserve for Bed Bath & Beyond?
 
Michael P. Fitzmaurice
RPT Realty - Executive VP & CFO
I think it's too early to tell with Bed Bath & Beyond at this point. Again, we are very happy with our locations. I think Brian commented on
in his prepared remarks that we're -- those are above-average stores. But in the event we do get them back, its low ABR per square foot
presenting us a huge opportunity. As far as the bad debt goes, I mean, this year, ex the favorable benefit we got from prior period
collections, we're on track to meet our 100 basis points of revenue as what our bad debt recognition will be for 2022. And I don't expect
that to change going into next year absent Bed Bath & Beyond.
 
Linda Tsai
Jefferies LLC, Research Division - Equity Analyst
Got it. And just one final question for Brian. When you talk to retailers, how are they thinking about store opening plans as they look to
2024? Is inflation or cost pressure part of their consideration?
 
Brian L. Harper
RPT Realty - President, CEO & Trustee
I mean we're looking at -- I mean, certainly, that comes up. And I think really having that low ABR portfolio helps. We will be able to still
drive rent, still allow them for healthy occupancy costs, given increases in their labor and costs. So it's a meeting of the minds on that.
And just given the low ABR and kind of the high-quality portfolio we have, I think that's a benefit. We're really looking even -- we're
signing leases for '24 and maybe even talking on some locations for '25 right now, Linda. So it's really looking outer years, too, and
there's been no let down at all.
 
Operator
We have next question from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho Securities.
 
Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division - MD of Americas Research & Senior Equity Research
Analyst
Just a few follow-ups from my end. First, I guess I wanted to get some clarity on Regal and Bed Bath. Do they pay rent? I guess, said
differently, did they not pay rent in September? And are they current on October? And what do you expect for November?
 
Michael P. Fitzmaurice
RPT Realty - Executive VP & CFO
They did not pay September rents, and that's across all their landlords. They did pay us October, and we fully expect them to pay
November and December.
 
Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division - MD of Americas Research & Senior Equity Research
Analyst
And that's Bed Bath and Regal?
 
Brian L. Harper
RPT Realty - President, CEO & Trustee
Bed Bath has paid everything and are current.
 
Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division - MD of Americas Research & Senior Equity Research
Analyst
Got it. Got it. Okay. And then on the SNO pipeline, I just want to get a bit of clarity on the big jump here from $9 million to $14 million this
quarter. How much of that is specifically attributable to Mary Brickell Village? Trying to understand, is that part of...
 
Brian L. Harper
RPT Realty - President, CEO & Trustee
Just $1 million of that $14 million is Mary Brickell. So the rest has been organic.
 
Michael P. Fitzmaurice
RPT Realty - Executive VP & CFO
Yes. Haendel, I'll give you a bridge from last quarter. We -- the last quarter is about $8.7 million as of the end of the second quarter. We
had about $1.5 million commenced during the quarter, which leaves us about $7.2 million. And then we signed $6.8 million of new leases
during the quarter, $1 million attributable to MBV, which gets us to that $14 million.
 
Haendel Emmanuel St. Juste
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division - MD of Americas Research & Senior Equity Research
Analyst
That's very helpful. And one more. Just the environment today, with transactions, clearly has been challenging, but just curious about the
remaining capacity in your JVs and your thoughts on deploying capital via the JVs here and maybe some opportunistic investments.
I'm curious what you have -- what you're currently thinking. Or if there's anything you're actively looking at, what type of IRRs minimum
you'd be looking for? Just curious on your views of deploying some of that JV capital over the next couple of quarters.
 
Brian L. Harper
RPT Realty - President, CEO & Trustee
Yes. Thanks, Haendel. So let's start with the net lease platform. We have $1.1 billion remaining capital to be deployed. We feel very good
on that cash of being patient and waiting for times of stress. So Tyler and team are building a great pipeline that we expect even further
cap rate widening. So we fully think that this is going to be a great environment to have capital, which we do, in that world.
Grocery-anchored, we have about $759 million remaining capital to be deployed. We talk to GIC all the time. There's a lot of
conversations going on positively on that platform. I would say from an IRR unlevered, what was, call it, 7% to 9% is now double digits.
But as I said in my prepared remarks, we're really being patient. We're waiting for things to settle or waiting to get some confirmation
from the Fed. But with that said, we still are looking in the universe and just seeing what's trading and trying to apply our data analytics
team towards that.
 
Operator
We have next question from the line of Mike Mueller with JPMorgan.
 
Michael William Mueller
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst
I tried to get off of the queue. My question was on where you thought you could be active on the investment front, but I guess it didn't
work out there. So I think I'm good.

We have next question from the line of Craig Schmidt with Bank of America.
 
Craig Richard Schmidt
BofA Securities, Research Division - Director
When you think about growing the small shop occupancy, where do you think the opportunity lies? In local tenants, or regional and
national?
 
Brian L. Harper
RPT Realty - President, CEO & Trustee
I think it's a combination. I think it's probably -- we have just some great tailwinds with the regional and nationals. And an example of a
deal in St. Louis, where it was more of a power center with Whole Foods. We've added Sephora. We're doing a lululemon deal, and that
was primarily a local small shop tenant that we've made about 80% national. We're seeing strong regionals in certain parts of Florida
and certainly in Boston. So I think it's going to be a mix, Craig, but I think probably heavier lean towards national and regional tenants.

BofA Securities, Research Division - Director
Great. And then I wonder, are you seeing any softening of sales in the hard good categories. We've seen a number of hard good retailers
take down their '22 guidance. And in addition, the U.S. Department of Commerce sales showed a weakness in the hard good categories.
 
Brian L. Harper
RPT Realty - President, CEO & Trustee
We're paying close attention to that. As of now, I think it's truly to tell from what our sales data captures. So we haven't seen any
significant boost one way or another in hard goods, but we are certainly seeing the same data that you saw, and we're keeping a close
eye on that.

We have next question from the line of Todd Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
 
Todd Michael Thomas
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division - MD & Senior Equity Research Analyst
Yes. Just wanted to circle back, I guess, to the external growth in the investment platform. Brian, you mentioned that unlevered IRRs of
7% to 9% are now double digits. Is that where required returns have moved? Or was that comment about something else?
And has GIC's appetite also slowed? Or are they looking to remain offensive here, perhaps take advantage of the decrease in
competition? And I guess like how do you manage that relationship with GIC just given where both of your cost of capitals and maybe
required return expectations are?
 
Brian L. Harper
RPT Realty - President, CEO & Trustee
Yes. So really, the return isn't a required return. That's really where I'm seeing that, of kind of this unsettled no man's land today. I think
things will settle where we'll be able to understand where those yields should be in the next several months or first quarter.
In speaking with GIC, their appetite has not slowed. There are a lot of conversations occurring with them. They're obviously very pleased
with the returns that we've provided on both platforms, and the relationship has gotten stronger. So I think that is more of a wait and see
on how we can align and really help each other grow the most efficiently and produce the highest returns for our shareholders and them.
So there's ongoing conversations.
 
Todd Michael Thomas
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division - MD & Senior Equity Research Analyst
Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then I just had one other question, and apologies if I missed this and you commented. But maybe,
Mike, in terms of sort of the holiday season or post-holiday season in early '23, are there any known move-outs or any potential vacates
that you're aware of today? Anything that's anticipated as we turned the corner into '23 at this point?
 
Michael P. Fitzmaurice
RPT Realty - Executive VP & CFO
I mean you're going to have your normal seasonal move-outs probably related to a small shop that you experience every year. But in
terms of any heavy anchor spaces at this point, no.

Brian L. Harper

Thank you, operator. Our positive third quarter results are a testament to the investments in our business that we have made over the
past few years. Our long-term focus, innovative approach and investments in people, processes and our portfolio have led to a more
resilient cash flow that we expect will produce consistent results year in and year out. Thank you all for joining our call this morning. Have
a wonderful day.
