Before turning the call over to Marc Holliday, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of SL Green Realty Corp., I would ask that those of
you participating in the Q&A portion of the call, please limit yourself to 2 questions per person. Thank you.
I will now turn the call over to Marc Holliday. Please go ahead, Marc.
 
Marc Holliday
SL Green Realty Corp. - Chairman & CEO
Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate you dialing in today, and we look forward to giving you an overview of our quarter's
results, taking your questions. So I want to remind everyone that since 2019, we faced many new challenges which, in turn, caused us to
raise our bar even higher and respond in ways that have been beneficial for our tenants, our shareholders and our community.
In less than 3 years, we signed over 5 million square feet of office leases. We completed 2 dozen individual sales transactions at a gross
price at share of $5 billion. We developed and acquired new world-class assets, oversaw and executed $2.25 billion of physical
construction projects for on-time deliveries, reduced our DPE balance to $663 million at quarter end. We created a new iconic global
entertainment destination, Summit.
We managed our portfolio in a safe, secure and efficient manner, launched a portfolio-wide hospitality and amenity program, and we did
all of this throughout by working 5 days a week from office, the only possible way we could have realized these extraordinary
accomplishments.
I want to once again express my extreme gratitude to the amazing and talented workforce here at SL Green, who came together, all of us
on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, to ring the closing bell and celebrate 25 years of excellence and improving the way which
New Yorkers live, work and play. And this momentum carried through into the most recent quarter.
I'm extremely, extremely pleased with the leasing performance in Q3, highlighted by the Franklin Templeton deal at One Madison
Avenue and the Memorial Sloan Kettering deal at 885 Third Avenue, which took a total of over 750,000 square feet of vacancy out of the
SL Green portfolio (inaudible) economic terms that were consistent with our expectations.
As pleased as I am with the leasing performance in Q3, I'm just as happy that we were able to retire $800 million of maturing public
bonds through a series of paydowns and financings that were done on attractive terms. Furthermore, we're highly focused on
implementing strategies to mitigate our exposure to rising interest rates by executing on a series of swaps, caps and debt repayment.
Understandably, a lot of the focus from the market is on the leasing performance and tenant demand. And on that front, we feel quite
good about where we are given the portfolio is highly improved and our overall asset quality has never been better.
We continue to amenitize our best assets to attract top tenants. And as a result, the portfolio is still well occupied today at 92%. And we
have marketing and capital plans in place that we believe will enable us to operate during this market cycle at or above 90% or better
until things begin to turn around.
Rising interest rates, on the other hand, are more of a concern given the impact it has on our earnings, making interest rate hedging and
debt reduction our #1 priority for the foreseeable future. I think Matt and his team have done an excellent job with this as evidenced by
the $1.25 billion of corporate swaps entered into during the third quarter to hedge future floating rate exposure. In addition, during the
most recent quarter, we entered into cap contracts and another $270 million of variable rate property debt. And just yesterday, we
swapped another $200 million on a floating rate mortgage.
Notwithstanding the current interest rate environment, the underlying New York City economy is still chugging along based on
employment data showing that NYC added 24,000 private sector jobs in August and is now 100,000 jobs ahead of New York City OMB's
original 2022 forecast.
More to the point, 22,500 office-using jobs have been created in just the last 3 months reported, now bringing the total office-using jobs
recovery to 104% of pre-pandemic high watermark. And contrary to what you may see in the media, I expect September's numbers do out
momentarily to show positive as well.
The numbers confirm what we feel that New York City is finally back to normal. The roads, sidewalks and commuter trains are packed
and the subways are coming back. Tourism and hospitality are near pre-pandemic levels. Residential rental market remains tight and
the enablement of conversion of office to resi to help solve this problem is gaining momentum at the state and city levels. Meetings,
conferences, parties, they fill the calendars. And the rhythm of New York social life has returned.
Before opening up the line for questions, I want to acknowledge a few other milestone moments for the company. First, Summit One
Vanderbilt is celebrating its 1-year anniversary tomorrow. We will all be there to recognize the successful launch of this world-class
attraction that has quickly become one of New York's hottest experiences, having welcomed 1.4 million guests to Summit during the first
year of operation with far more expected next year.
During the third quarter, we prevailed in consolidating ownership and control of 245 Park Avenue, a trophy asset in the SL Green
Corridor of owned properties after a contentious bankruptcy litigation. We have plans to improve 245 Park over the next 24 months to
make it one of the most desirable buildings on Park Avenue. Last week, we received the excellent news that Le Pavillon received a
Michelin Star less than 18 months after opening during the pandemic.
And finally, this morning, we announced a partnership with Caesars Entertainment to pursue a downstate casino license for a
world-class gaming hotel and entertainment venue in the heart of Times Square. In connection with this effort, we have formed a
coalition for a better Time Square that seeks to make significant investment in security, traffic mitigation, mass transit improvements and
accelerate economic recovery for surrounding businesses and create good paying jobs for local New Yorkers.
With that summary, we'd like to open up the line for questions on the quarter and whatever else is on people's minds.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 
Operator
(Operator Instructions)
Our first question comes from Alexander Goldfarb with Piper Sandler.
 
Alexander David Goldfarb
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst
So 2 questions. First, just taking a look at bringing on converting the DPE positions for 5 Times Square and 245 Park. Just want to
understand, one, the earnings impact because I think you were getting close to 11% on the DPE positions previously, and I'm not sure how
that equates to a cap rate on the buildings. Two, I think you have some large vacancies coming in 245 Park. So maybe, Matt, if you could
just talk about how we should think about the economics and impact to earnings from converting those 2 positions.
 
Matthew J. DiLiberto
SL Green Realty Corp. - CFO
Sure. I'll let Steve address the 245 Park vacancy question you had. As earnings, obviously, we'll be giving guidance for 2023 on
December 5 at our investor conference. So you'll get more detail then. You alluded to the DPE balances rolling off. That's about $367
million of debt and preferred equity investments combined between 245 and 5 Times that we're rolling off at just short of 11%.
You're right, the properties do not generate that equivalent return on their face. 5 Times is in redevelopment and lease up. We only own
30% -- 32% roughly of that. And 245, we own 100% of. There will be finalization of GAAP adjustments and those types of things done
over the coming weeks leading into our guidance for 2023, but the roll-off is substantial at $367 million at near 11%.
 
Steven M. Durels
SL Green Realty Corp. - Executive VP & Director of Leasing & Real Property
And then with regards to vacancy or pending vacancy at the building, we really don't have as much as I think you may suspect. The
JPMorgan space, which is 17 floors in the building, 15 of those floors were either previously leased to Soc Gen or while we were doing the
leasing for HNA, we had pre-let 5 of the floors to Houlihan Lokey. So that only leaves us 2 floors to really deal with when we get that
space back late next year.
Other than that, there's about 120,000 square feet of current vacancy. There's another block in the building that we get back out late this
year -- I'm sorry, late next year, Major League Baseball, which had roughly 5 floors. We had pre-leased most of that space on short-term
leases to either Rockefeller Group or Houlihan Lokey. So we'll now get it back mid- to end of next year. Other than that, just smattering of
floors throughout the building. And that sort of rollover the next couple of years is what's justifying the capital program that were in
design for the building right now, which we're really excited about.
Just to remind everybody, this product is exactly what the world is looking for today. It's side core design has a floor plate design that has
actually 6 corners on it, the way it's configured, sits directly catty corner to JPMorgan's new headquarters, has direct access to Grand
Central Terminal.
Our development plan, which is going to be a spectacular transformation of the building, from the Plaza to the lobby to amenities being
added is, I think, very forward thinking. And we're already trading paper with prospective tenants. So I have the greatest of confidence
that this building will outperform.
 
Alexander David Goldfarb
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division - MD & Senior Research Analyst
Okay. And then the second question is, Matt, on the swaps, a lot of news in press reports about the rise in cost of swaps, but you guys
have been quite active. Can you just give some perspective how much pricing has changed? And should we think about swaps being
prohibitive or based on the fact that you guys are still executing them earlier this week, that prices may have gone off but in the scheme
of things, given debt costs, still plenty of availability and cost effectiveness on the swaps for your debt?
 
Matthew J. DiLiberto
SL Green Realty Corp. - CFO
Yes. Certainly, the latter, not the former. And I think Marc alluded to the fact that we're going to continue to target reducing future
floating rate debt exposure through caps and swaps. You talk about cost. Technically the way it works, cost for a swap is built in through
a credit charge, which is just measured in basis points on top of the rate that you swap. On the $1.250 billion, it was roughly 5 basis
points on average, so not much. Caps have an upfront cost and those costs are based on the term and the benchmark.
So there has been some press about increasing cost. I think cost of everything has gone up. But certainly, the savings we're realizing by
executing on these trades far exceeds whatever incremental costs may be embedded in them, just to put that in perspective on the
$1.250 billion that we did and was included in the press release, that was done more than 100 basis points tighter than where you would
do those today. On $1.250 billion, you can do the simple math. 100 basis points of $1.250 billion over the course of several years, that's a
lot of money, well worth a couple of basis points.
 
Operator
Our next question comes from Steve Sakwa with Evercore ISI.
 
Stephen Thomas Sakwa
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD & Senior Equity Research Analyst
I guess, Steve, I was just wondering if you could comment a little bit more on kind of where the pipeline sits today, given that big tech has
sort of gone on hold. I'm just curious what parts of the market are you seeing the most demand in, whether it be size attendance or what
part of New York? Is it Midtown South, Midtown? Any color on leasing would be great.
 
Steven M. Durels
SL Green Realty Corp. - Executive VP & Director of Leasing & Real Property
Sure. Well, we've got a pipeline that's about 700,000 square feet. Obviously, that number is down as a result of the 2 big leases that we
recently signed. But I think the good news in that pipeline is we're seeing a lot more activity from the small- to medium-sized tenants,
which is -- is it changed from where the market was for the past 6 or 9 months because a lot of the leasing activity, although the year is
doing -- broadly speaking, the market is doing well compared to the prior 2 years, velocity is still down compared to sort of the 10-year
average.
But the success in the market this year has been driven largely by the bigger tenants. And I think the new news, like you said, is that they
were starting to see these small- to medium-sized tenants coming back into the market as the bigger tenants, the higher price point
tenants that are signing leases were the first ones into the market. The small- to medium-sized guys are sitting on the sidelines. And as
the big guys are bringing their employees back to the office, you're now seeing those smaller guys follow them into the office, and that's
driving a lot more leasing activity.
So some of our Third Avenue, Lexington Avenue product, we have more tours, trading paper and signing leases today than we have been
in the past year or so. So I think that's positive. I think Midtown is still, without a doubt, the driver of the overall leasing velocity in the
marketplace. Financial Services is some 41%, 42% of total leasing that was signed in the third quarter.
Tech is still out there, but obviously, in a much smaller diminished way, they're kind of 8% to 10% of total leasing. But financial services,
which in the past couple of years was sort of in that 30% range. They're now 40-plus, and I think there doesn't seem to be any slowdown
in that segment's demand.
You're also seeing law firms a lot more active today than they were a year ago. And I think that same demographic is what we're seeing
within our portfolio. Of our pipeline, about 17% is financial services, 12% is tech and the balance is everything from government to
healthcare to services.
 
Stephen Thomas Sakwa
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD & Senior Equity Research Analyst
And if I could just ask a quick follow-up on that. Do most of these requirements, are they kind of downsizing? Are they kind of including
growth space? Are they just kind of musical chairs moving out of 150,000 foot into another? Just what can you say about size?
 
Steven M. Durels
SL Green Realty Corp. - Executive VP & Director of Leasing & Real Property
Well, there's an unusual amount of relocations taking place in the city as tenants reinvent their workplaces. Typically, about 30% of
leases that get signed are relocations. Third quarter, it was over 40% of the leases that were signed were relocations. And I think that's a
function of tenants that are continuing to densify, that was a pre-COVID phenomenon that never stopped, and they're reinventing how
they want to use their workplace. So more amenities, more space per employee and more hospitality vibe in their design. And without a
doubt, people are -- most businesses are still very unsettled about what their ultimate footprint is going to be. They don't -- they just
don't know. So they're building in a lot of flexibility on ability to grow and ability to downsize as time goes by because the world is still
figuring itself out.
 
Stephen Thomas Sakwa
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division - Senior MD & Senior Equity Research Analyst
Got it. And then, Marc, I know it's early and you just put out the press release with Caesars on the gaming license. I guess I'm just trying
to sort of think through that building is obviously encumbered with a large tenant. And I'm just trying to think through sort of the concept
of a vertical casino in New York versus one that's more horizontal. I mean can you just kind of share any thoughts with us about that?
 
Marc Holliday
SL Green Realty Corp. - Chairman & CEO
Steve, there'll be lots coming out over the course of the next several months. We expect the RFP out sometime in December, but that's
not official or formal or announced from the state. That's just our expectation, could be before, could be after. Suffice it to say, we have --
what we and Caesars think is an excellent plan for bringing gaming and entertainment and hotel right to the heart of Times Square. I
think we wouldn't do anything less than a world-class facility laid out in a way that we think will be extremely successful and desirable
and additive to Times Square, which I think really could use a boost right now. So I would say, stay tuned for those details. Will be more
to come and stuff that I and the team are really excited about. Thanks for the question.

Our next question comes from Michael Griffin with Citi.
 
Michael Anderson Griffin
Citigroup Inc. Exchange Research - Senior Associate
Great. Maybe we go back to the refinancing for a moment, debt maturities coming up. Is there any ability to get longer-term refinancing
on some of these? Or are the expectations more the shorter-term floating rate debt actually meant kind of similar to this $400 million
term loan.
 
Andrew W. Mathias
SL Green Realty Corp. - President & Director
I would -- I mean, at the moment, the CMBS market for single assets is not as compelling as the shorter-term market. So you'll probably
see us use the shorter-term market at the moment. As soon as that single-asset CMBS window reopens, which no dealers have been able
to tell us exactly when it will happen, but hopefully it will be by the first of the year, then we'll start to avail ourselves of longer-term
fixed-rate financing.
 
Matthew J. DiLiberto
SL Green Realty Corp. - CFO
And just with regard to the $400 million corporate facility, remember, what we're trying to accomplish there. We are ultimately going to
-- we had to pay off maturing bonds, $500 million which we've done. And we were doing that in a way that can be repaid 1 year from now
when we get money from our partners at One Madison, just short of $600 million. The bank financing market for that kind of term is well
inside of what any bond execution look like, probably 200 basis points inside. So that's why we went that route.
 
Michael Anderson Griffin
Citigroup Inc. Exchange Research - Senior Associate
Got you. That's definitely helpful. And then we saw some details released recently around Local Law 97 in New York. I understand things
are still preliminary. Can you give a sense of how it could impact your portfolio? And can you highlight any special (inaudible) make sure
your portfolio is going to be in compliance?
 
Marc Holliday
SL Green Realty Corp. - Chairman & CEO
This is Local Law 97?
 
Matthew J. DiLiberto
SL Green Realty Corp. - CFO
Yes.
 
Marc Holliday
SL Green Realty Corp. - Chairman & CEO
No, I mean this is -- the rules were formally adopted recently, but this is something we've been preparing for, for years so it's been out
there. The first measurement date, we think the bulk of the portfolio, if not all the portfolio, will pass in compliance without penalty. And
then in the 2030 date, we're going to be working, obviously, over the next 7, 8 years on making additional investments and exploring
ways to use renewable energies and credits and everything that will be available to try and eliminate entirely whatever penalties there
will be in 2030, we'll probably go into more detail on this in December at the investor conference to give people a better sense of where
the issues lie, a range of quantifications.
But we don't have that here now. And I would say that until 2030, at the earliest, we expect it to be of no financial consequence, not
because the rules are not rigorous, but simply because we've invested so much in the portfolio. And we have -- so many of our buildings
are LEED-designated, WELL-designated, ENERGY STAR recipients, et cetera, that we score very well on the current metrics, which is
evolving.
Yes, those rules will evolve over time, and we'll see what the state of play is in 7 or 8 years, but we're preparing as though what's been
promulgated is what we'll have to live with.
 
Operator
Our next question comes from Anthony Paolone with JPMorgan.
 
Anthony Paolone
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst
I guess first question is for Marc. Can you talk about where you think the balance sheet leverage should be, over time, you mentioned the
priority of debt paydown. And so just wondering how you're thinking about it and especially in the context of the asset-light strategy you
guys have articulated.
 
Marc Holliday
SL Green Realty Corp. - Chairman & CEO
Yes. Just on the issue of debt pay down, it's not so much a leverage ratio question in my mind. I think we are very fairly leveraged and
many are under-leveraged relative to what I think a loan -- a proper loan-to-value would be in this market. The debt reduction really is
pointedly towards preserving and protecting our earnings from increasing rates and variable rate debt. So it's -- at a leverage point, we
feel and have always felt very comfortable where we sit today with our leverage relative to an asset base that we think has a value far, far
in excess of where the stock trades today and even given where the stock trades today. However, we have about, Matt, I want to say
maybe $2 billion or so unhedged at this point. So we're over 80% hedged at the moment, right? And so therefore, what we're talking
about is managing the risk, if you will, on that -- whatever that is, 17%, 18% unhedged position which I would like to reduce further, again,
not from a credit or balance sheet standpoint, but purely from an earnings standpoint to protect ourselves from volatile increases in
interest rates.
 
Anthony Paolone
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Analyst
Okay. Got it. And then just a follow-up. On the DPE book, a lot of it is set to mature next year. I mean should we think about this as being
the end? And also, do you anticipate just getting paid back on all this, I guess, outside of 625 perhaps? Or do you think other properties
might have to come on to the books?
 
Andrew W. Mathias
SL Green Realty Corp. - President & Director
Well, it's definitely not the end. This has been a very important program for us. It's returned us terrific IRRs over the course of the
program. And we tend to invest in at the bottom of the cycle. So debt investments are most effective when we can make them in distress
type situations. And if we do see those type of situations, we will definitely be taking advantage of them in the debt book. In terms of the
maturities, time will tell what the refinancing markets look like, what the property markets look like. Sitting here today, we can't predict
sort of what's going to happen in the future at existing loan maturities, but we were happy with the outcomes, obviously, on 245 Park
and 5 Times Square. And I definitely wouldn't call the book defunct by any stretch.
 
Operator
Our next question comes from John Kim with BMO.
 
John P. Kim
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Senior U.S. Real Estate Analyst
You guys talked about the improvement you could make at 245 Park over the next couple of years and the former owner was
capital-constrained. So I was wondering if you can comment on how much CapEx will be needed to upgrade the building? And also, if
you can comment on the timing of finding a joint venture partner.
 
Marc Holliday
SL Green Realty Corp. - Chairman & CEO
I would say, needed is -- there's a lot you can work into what's needed at the property. I mean the property leases in its current state. And
we've done actually a lot of lease and how much, Steve?
 
Steven M. Durels
SL Green Realty Corp. - Executive VP & Director of Leasing & Real Property
Probably 200-plus thousand square feet.
 
Marc Holliday
SL Green Realty Corp. - Chairman & CEO
Yes. We've done about 200,000 square feet plus. The building is a very good building. But -- and I don't think needs for much. However,
what -- to bring it up to where we want it to be, to its full potential, and be consistent with some of the great properties within the
portfolio that have extensive amenities, et cetera, we're going to go in sort of electively and voluntarily, I would expect any program of
size to be under $100 a foot. So I don't mean that to sound de minimis. It's a big building. That's up to 1.8 million square foot building.
And that's -- the beauty of the situation here is we can amortize some substantial improvement dollars over a very large asset. And for
relatively, I'll call it, modest incremental investment per square foot, we can take our already low basis for our Park Avenue asset of, I
think, about $1,100 a foot, if I'm not mistaken, maybe even slightly under that.
And like I said, make a very large dollar amount, but a small relative per square foot improvement amount for improvements,
beautification, efficiencies, new lobby, plaza, amenities and still have a basis, very low by Park Avenue standards, and I think have one of
the best buildings with one of the best views sitting right on top of access to Grand Central Station.
 
John P. Kim
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Senior U.S. Real Estate Analyst
And the timing of a JV partner?
 
Marc Holliday
SL Green Realty Corp. - Chairman & CEO
The -- well, I mean, we're looking. I mean we'll begin those conversations in this quarter. And that will -- that's one of our priorities for --
will be one of our priorities for 2023 will be identification and closing of a JV partner. But we, I guess, already have begun filling the
inbound and will be sort of proactively marketing outbound this quarter.
 
John P. Kim
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Senior U.S. Real Estate Analyst
Okay. My second question...
 
Marc Holliday
SL Green Realty Corp. - Chairman & CEO
It doesn't mean it's going to close this quarter. It just means we're going to start the process this quarter. These processes, really it can
take anywhere from 4 to 6 months, I would say, on balance.
 
John P. Kim
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research - Senior U.S. Real Estate Analyst
Got it. On the Caesars joint venture, can you provide any more color on the structure of the JV? Is it just going to be you and Allianz on the
real estate and Caesars is the operator and that's going to be separate? Or will there be co-ownership to follow? And if you could also
confirm if this is an exclusive to both you and Caesars cases for a New York Casino license.
 
Marc Holliday
SL Green Realty Corp. - Chairman & CEO
Yes. In terms of -- maybe I'll sort of do a blanket statement for the many questions that may follow. Any details of the project, the bid, the
structure, all of that is going to be something that we're going to address as other bidders will address over time and in response to an
RFP that hasn't been issued yet. So I want to put an emphasis on that. There is no RFP from the state right now for a downstate casino
license award. That is anticipated to occur. So the answer to your second -- or third question was, yes, we are exclusive with Caesars on
this casino site and we're going to be putting both of our mutual best efforts behind it to make it happen because we think it's not just a
big opportunity for the state and city, but it's almost -- it's a rallying point for Times Square to have a catalyst of something very positive
to help redirect some of the degradation we've seen in that area, and we know Time Square as best, there's nothing better in the world.
It's the best entertainment district in the world, barnone, but there are moments in time, particularly coming on the heels of this
pandemic, where an area like Times Square, it's not the only area in New York City, but an area like Times Square needs help and needs
to reboot itself and I think we can rally around a casino and make that the engine and economic engine around which we could really
have a Times Square renaissance much in the way that you've seen a Grand Central renaissance over the past few years.
 
Operator
Our next question comes from Tom Catherwood with BTIG.
 
William Thomas Catherwood
BTIG, LLC, Research Division - Director & REIT Analyst
Steve, maybe turn it over to One Madison. Obviously, 2 kind of anchor tenants in there at this point in time. Now that you've reached this
kind of 55%-plus level of pre-leasing how does your marketing program shift at all? Do you become more selective with tenants? Are you
able to start pushing rents at this point in time? Is there anything that changes once you reach this level?
 
Steven M. Durels
SL Green Realty Corp. - Executive VP & Director of Leasing & Real Property
Yes, we've already raised rents as a result of the leases that we've signed. But first and foremost is to remind the brokers community that
we still have space. I think a lot of people are under the impression that we are fully leased in the building. So we're out there reminding
people that we still got space to offer. We're actively trading paper with a couple of tenants now in the tower of the building. And we're
still seeing pretty strong tour activity. I think it's going to pick up even further towards the end of this year once we start to have the steel
in place for the new tower and we can do site tours.
Up until this point, all of our marketing has really been done out of our boardroom off of renderings and off of a presentation deck and
really not with site visits. And what we saw at One Madison -- One Vanderbilt Avenue is that once we could do site tours, the place is
really exploded because people got so excited about the quality of the development, what the views are like, what the volume of space
really feels like, and it takes on a whole different character and pace to the leasing program. So we top out steel in November of this year,
and I think we'll be doing site tours towards the end of the year or early next year. So that's really where the thrust of our focus will be.
 
William Thomas Catherwood
BTIG, LLC, Research Division - Director & REIT Analyst
Got it. Appreciate that. And then maybe Marc or Andrew, when you're thinking of sources and uses going forward, obviously, one of the
big priorities has been repaying the unsecured bonds. You got that resolved, but the new projects obviously add more capital
requirements, whether it's 450 Park or 245 Park or 5 Times Square. How do you think about allocating capital to those while at the same
point in time kind of reducing your floating rate debt? What gets prioritized or kind of where do you hit a challenge in that capital
allocation, if at all?
 
Andrew W. Mathias
SL Green Realty Corp. - President & Director
Well, I think the primary source of capital will be asset sales. And in terms of specifics, 5 Times Square will be 0 incremental capital. That
deal was sort of fully funded at capitalization with new cash equity that did not come from our side of the ledger, came from the other
partners in the deal. So there's 0 incremental capital need there.
And then as we said, 245 Park, where we have this active search for a joint venture partner ongoing, and we'd expect the proceeds of that
joint venture sale to cover most, if not all, the capital required by that building.

Our next question comes from Michael Lewis from Truist.
 
Michael Robert Lewis
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division - Director & Co-Lead REIT Analyst
I have a question about the term loan and the swaps. And I'm wondering if there was any change in the amount or the composition of the
banks that kind of came to the table to help you get that done? Because we've heard that some large lenders have pulled back on
commercial real estate lending. So I'm wondering not just about the pricing of that, but kind of the availability of capital in the market.
 
Matthew J. DiLiberto
SL Green Realty Corp. - CFO
Yes, Mike, it's Matt. No question. It's tough out there. A lot of banks are pulling back in various areas. So to hit the market with a facility
like this is not without its challenges. But we went to very close relationship institutions who stepped into it. They are all participants in
our existing credit facility. Some are participants in the One Madison financing. And given that this facility is pursuant to funds coming
from One Madison, they have a great deal of certainty around the success of that project, and therefore, the funds coming in. But yes,
there's plenty of nodes in this environment just because capital allocation or restrictions are keeping a lot of banks handcuffed.
 
Michael Robert Lewis
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division - Director & Co-Lead REIT Analyst
Okay. And my second question, kind of piecing together, I guess, some of the other questions that were already asked. As you look at JV
partners and maybe selling some assets, what's kind of the depth of that market, right? So with interest rates up, leverage buyers under
pressure, is there capital out there to get those deals done? And does the pricing take a significant hit? Or do you feel pretty good about
what you'll be able to do those deals at?
 
Marc Holliday
SL Green Realty Corp. - Chairman & CEO
Well, I mean, I think we feel good relative to the kind of product we're bringing to the JV market. It's still sort of irreplaceable Class A,
often trophy-like assets and for that I'd say there's always demand in every market. That demand often shifts from investor to investor or
from country of origin to country of origin. But I think that for the balance of '22, you're not going to see -- a lot of people are going to
have more limited capacity. But in '23, there, we believe, will be certainly new investment mandates to put money to work, but only in
best markets, best properties, best sponsorship. I mean it's like almost anything in a dislocated market or a challenged market because
of what Matt has talked about on the debt front.
Only the best deals are going to get done in the grade A markets with very competent sponsorship. So in that regard, we go into it very
confidently that we've got the right product, the right returns for this market, the right valuation levels, the proof will be in the execution.
 
Andrew W. Mathias
SL Green Realty Corp. - President & Director
In the case of 245, the right in-place financing.
 
Marc Holliday
SL Green Realty Corp. - Chairman & CEO
Yes. Well, that said, it's a great point Andrew makes, it's a fully financed deal, so that certainly helps. But with or without it.
 
Andrew W. Mathias
SL Green Realty Corp. - President & Director
(inaudible) most new deals (technical difficulty) is taken off the table in 245 Park.

Our next question comes from [Daniel Tuche] with Scotiabank.
 
Nicholas Philip Yulico
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division - Analyst
Nick Yulico here. So just a question on 245 Park. How are you guys -- you talked about some of the capital plans, but how should we
think about how you underwrote a stabilized yield on that building post renovation?
 
Marc Holliday
SL Green Realty Corp. - Chairman & CEO
Well, stabilize, what kind of yield? Cash on cost, unlevered IRR, levered IRR, just...
 
Nicholas Philip Yulico
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division - Analyst
Yes. Cash on cost would be great.
 
Marc Holliday
SL Green Realty Corp. - Chairman & CEO
Cash on cost, stabilized cash on cost would have to -- look, I think we've got -- let me sort of go back to front. We've got levered returns
on our basis that, I think, would exceed 50% based on where we can execute for a great a trophy-office property right across from
JPMorgan's new world headquarters. How does that translate...
 
Andrew W. Mathias
SL Green Realty Corp. - President & Director
Still green, it's low 6 is cash on hand.
 
Nicholas Philip Yulico
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division - Analyst
Okay. Great. And I guess just going back to the -- in that case, you do have the in-place debt on the building, which is attractive low 4% --
if you were to think about that building or another building in New York trading right now, you have to put new acquisition debt on it.
Your on rate on that you can get, it's going to be somewhere over 6%, let's say. How is that in your mind affecting values in the market?
Does that mean that starting cap rates for New York and that type of situation, if you have to finance it over 6% starting cap rates have to
be closer to 7% or higher?
 
Marc Holliday
SL Green Realty Corp. - Chairman & CEO
No. No change. I mean this -- no different than you have inverted interest rates. You're going to have cap rates below financing rates
because New York, Class A (inaudible) family is not going to be -- office is not going to be a 7 cap. You're looking -- a cap rate is a
perpetual in place expected rate of return over a spread to treasuries, minus growth rate based on long-term treasuries. That has no --
you're talking about discount rate, it has no bearing to a cap -- or New York City cap rates today, I still think are solidly for the best assets
in the 4s, maybe for a more mid-market product in the 5s, I haven't heard anything about 7s. I mean is that -- do you have a transaction
in mind that traded in Midtown at north of 7?
 
Nicholas Philip Yulico
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division - Analyst
Well, no. So I think part of the problem is that there aren't that many transactions, but everything we're hearing is that negative leverage
is a problem, particularly for office, if you underwrite in the market.
 
Marc Holliday
SL Green Realty Corp. - Chairman & CEO
Negative leverage is a fact of New York City. That's been doing this for 30-some years. This is...
 
Matthew J. DiLiberto
SL Green Realty Corp. - CFO
Nick.
 
Marc Holliday
SL Green Realty Corp. - Chairman & CEO
Nick. Negative leverage is often the case in New York City. It's called often in people.
 
Andrew W. Mathias
SL Green Realty Corp. - President & Director
If you're building with vacancy, there's going to be negative leverage.
 
Marc Holliday
SL Green Realty Corp. - Chairman & CEO
Yes. Even -- people will generally be making long-term 10-, 50-year investments ideally, I mean you'd love to be in a positive -- strong
positive leverage going on, I'm not arguing that. But it is not unusual in New York to buy negative leverage and work your way up on cash
on cost to get to even or positive leverage to create -- depends on the market, but high single-digit IRRs. So no, I wouldn't say it's -- not
for trophy, I mean, this 400 million -- 410 million square feet of assets in New York, not all the same. I'm just talking -- you said a
building like a 245. So I'm responding to that, a 7-plus cap rate would be, I think, empty set.
 
Nicholas Philip Yulico
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division - Analyst
Okay. Even if someone could put debt on that building today would have to replace it at well over 6%, even if you can get (inaudible).
 
Marc Holliday
SL Green Realty Corp. - Chairman & CEO
I don't see -- I don't know where that debt would be. That's your debt. I don't know where that would be in there.
 
Nicholas Philip Yulico
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division - Analyst
It's just spreads. I mean the spreads in the market are pretty much...
 
Marc Holliday
SL Green Realty Corp. - Chairman & CEO
I hear you. But you know something? We just closed a corporate facility by how much? 140 over. Now in your mind, maybe it's like 7 plus,
but...
 
Nicholas Philip Yulico
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division - Analyst
No, no, no. I understand you need a term loan staying in the market to get property debt.
 
Marc Holliday
SL Green Realty Corp. - Chairman & CEO
Nick, please. You asked me a question. I'm going to give you my opinion. If you don't agree...
 
Nicholas Philip Yulico
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division - Analyst
I just want to make sure I understand. You still think cap rates in New York are for stabilized assets, not turnaround assets are
somewhere in the 4% and 5%.
 
Marc Holliday
SL Green Realty Corp. - Chairman & CEO
No. I am going to be very specific, but then I'm going to move on to the next question. I think stabilized cap rates -- well, I'd say cap rates
for assets like 245 has improved with us at the helm in this market across from JPMorgan's $5 billion to $6 billion investment, a few
blocks up the road from One Vanderbilt down to (inaudible) 425 Park carries a sub-5 cap rate. And does not carry a 7.5 cap rate. That's it.
No other words on that. That's my feeling on it. And if you disagree, you disagree, which is what makes a market. I have no problem with
them. I'm just saying that's my opinion.
 
Operator
Our next question comes from Blaine Heck with Wells Fargo.
 
Blaine Matthew Heck
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Analyst
Marc, you talked a little bit about this in your prepared remarks that now that we've moved past Labor Day, I'm curious what you guys are
seeing in terms of tenant space usage or utilization days in the office per week and maybe even times of day that are most active at the
office.
 
Marc Holliday
SL Green Realty Corp. - Chairman & CEO
Yes. I'd say that like many others are experiencing right now, the -- there's 2 work weeks. There's the Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
work week, where I'd say we're almost back to close to pre-pandemic levels. At least that's how it feels like, and the numbers are in
excess of 60% pre-pandemic, our full occupancy might have been 70% or 70-some-odd percent. We don't have exact numbers on
(inaudible).
Certain buildings are higher than that where the tenant base is more back to work. Then we have certain tenants that may be more
remote, so it fluctuates a bit, but I'm giving you the averages. And then Mondays and Fridays, particularly Fridays, you might see physical
occupancy at 30%. Now all those numbers are increasing, and we see that in the numbers we're getting. But this -- Fridays were off in
like New York City. So we're not measuring against 100% on Fridays New York City. I mean people are out, PTO, traveling, doing
business, et cetera.
So it has the feel for 3 to almost 4 days a week, like a pre-pandemic market. And I come off the train the other day, I mean that train is
full. That platform is full. You can't -- the time it took to get out the doors into the main theater Grand Central was measured in minutes,
many minutes, not seconds because that platform was packed. And it has a very good feel right now, in my opinion. I don't know
anybody...
 
Steven M. Durels
SL Green Realty Corp. - Executive VP & Director of Leasing & Real Property
I'll add to it. I mean just statistically, Metro North ridership is, if I remember the stat correctly, is like 9% greater than it was
pre-pandemic. Car traffic is 5.5% or 6% greater than it was pre-pandemic, we're still less than COVID numbers as long on -- railroad is
still at a lower number. But to Marc's earlier point, the trend line is such that ridership and people coming back in the city and people
occupying the offices is on the upward slope and we're seeing that consistently improve week over week.
 
Blaine Matthew Heck
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Senior Equity Analyst
That's helpful. Second question. It seems as though the highest quality and highest price points were certainly the most active during the
pandemic, and I assume that can't last forever. So I'm wondering how the pace of leasing activity has trended in some of your lower rent
buildings. Are you guys seeing much of the pickup in activity there relative to kind of what you saw during the pandemic?
 
Steven M. Durels
SL Green Realty Corp. - Executive VP & Director of Leasing & Real Property
We're seeing -- well, as I said earlier, we're seeing more tours and proposals and lease signings in our sort of mid-price point buildings,
which I think are largely dominated by the smaller to midsized tenants. That's not yet translated into enough signed leases to really
move the needle, but just off of a tour activity and expressions of interest, it's improved. It's still a struggle because those small and
medium-sized guys are late to the game.
 
Operator
Our next question comes from Tayo Okusanya with Credit Suisse.
 
Omotayo Tejamude Okusanya
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division - Analyst
Yes. Two quick ones from me. First of all, in regards to the swaps. An earlier comment about, again, just having more hedging going
forward. I mean, could you just talk to just how much you kind of ultimately expect to be hedged by, given you have about $3 billion of
kind of variable debt between the consolidated and unconsolidated JVs?
 
Matthew J. DiLiberto
SL Green Realty Corp. - CFO
Yes. So let's talk the numbers first. We had about $2.4 billion unhedged floating on just sort of $12 billion of debt. Our target floating rate
ratio is kind of 15% to 20%. So we're already at or below that number. But we're going to target all of our existing floating rate debt as
much of it as we possibly can because we don't unilaterally control some of it to hedge. So we just -- beyond the end of the quarter, we
did another $200 million swap of floating to fixed.
Yesterday, we're zoned in on another almost $400 million of property level floating rate debt. And then there will be debt pay down. We
want to look at the credit facility, our revolving credit facility and our goal is to always have that near 0.
So with proceeds from asset sales or other activity, we'll try and get that down to 0. That's also floating rate debt. So it's a combination of
caps, swaps and debt repayment, as Marc said in his opening comments, and we are -- even though we are at or below our target, we're
going for more because we want to protect earnings and cash flow.
 
Omotayo Tejamude Okusanya
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division - Analyst
Got you. Okay. That's helpful. And then 717 Fifth Avenue and 650 Fifth Avenue with the debt maturities there and the ongoing kind of
conversations with the lenders, I mean, what's kind of the ultimate kind of goal there with those 2 assets.
 
Andrew W. Mathias
SL Green Realty Corp. - President & Director
Well, we're not the managing partner at 717, we have very small passive interest there. So I think the hope is to get an extension from the
existing lender group. And I would say 1552 is much the same. The Times Square retail has obviously been heavily impacted by the
pandemic, and we expect the lender to be appreciative of those impacts.
 
Matthew J. DiLiberto
SL Green Realty Corp. - CFO
And you mentioned 650, 650 Fifth, we did a short-term extension.
 
Omotayo Tejamude Okusanya
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division - Analyst
Right. But after the 6-month extension that expires like in April or so next year, right? So I think longer term it's the idea...
 
Matthew J. DiLiberto
SL Green Realty Corp. - CFO
Part of the exercise with extensions is evaluating the financing market at the time. So we felt with the lender, the best thing to do at this
point was extend it 6 months and in 6 months, we'll consider it again and maybe do another 6 months, another 12 months until we get to
more comfortable position. Right. And if the markets look cooperative, we'll do something longer term.
 
Operator
Our next question comes from Anthony Powell with Barclays.
 
Anthony Franklin Powell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Research Analyst
Marc, I think you mentioned the prospect of office to residential conversions. Have you talked -- any context to what people at the mayor
and the governor -- are there plans in place to maybe to systematically reduce some of the office, I guess, availability out there of stock in
New York through these conversions. Could something be announced in the next few quarters? I'm curious because I think this issue of
maybe (inaudible) and I mean, it comes up a lot in our conversation. So if a plan is under way to kind of get that started, that will be super
helpful. So what's your view on that prospect for the next few quarters?
 
Marc Holliday
SL Green Realty Corp. - Chairman & CEO
So I understand the question. The question is, what do I think is the real timeline of our prospect of getting something accomplished at
state and city level? Is that...
 
Anthony Franklin Powell
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Research Analyst
Yes. And just a broad -- office to residential or office conversion (inaudible) program.
 
Marc Holliday
SL Green Realty Corp. - Chairman & CEO
I think the best -- this is one of the topics that we're going to be featuring in about 6 weeks at the investor conference, stepping through
what it takes to get a building from office to resi, from a physical standpoint, from a zoning standpoint, from a building code standpoint,
it's very doable. We've done it. Many have done it. There are ways to make it easier, better, more efficient to turn right now what's a very
small pipeline of office to resi into a much larger pipeline of office to resi. Obviously, one of those big elements would be a tax break
along the line of what 421-g was downtown. When Downtown had substantial problems after 9/11 and that in and of itself is being
looked at, but it's being looked at in coordination with the kind of changes that I mentioned, some of which will take time to implement.
So I think that a program can come about in 2023 in terms of directional, but in terms of actually seeing buildings converted, I would
guess that's '24 and beyond. But I do think that you could see upwards of 10 million square feet of office sort of taken out of the equation
for conversion, pursuant to a new program if the economics and the zoning are there to make it happen. So it's a much longer discussion,
it's a detailed discussion that, Anthony, if you don't mind, I want to defer until our investor conference when we're going to be speaking to
that directly.
 
Operator
Our next question comes from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley.
 
Ronald Kamdem
Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Equity Analyst
Two quick ones from me. Just when you're thinking about those 23 lease roll at this point, any commentary on how much is rolled, how
much is left to do, what that's shaking out?
 
Steven M. Durels
SL Green Realty Corp. - Executive VP & Director of Leasing & Real Property
Well, we're -- as you can imagine, we've been, for the better part of this year, working on the '23 expirations already. So we have very
good clarity on every single tenant as to who's likely to stay or not. We're actually going through our budgets -- building our budgets for
next year.
So we have a granular tenant-by-tenant assumption for everybody that's rolling and each piece of vacancy that we have today. And I
don't think there's any surprises as we sit here today as to where we thought -- which tenants were going to stay or go compared to
where we saw those -- how we saw those tenants probably 12 months ago.
 
Ronald Kamdem
Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Equity Analyst
And any chance -- any way to quantify that? Is it 20%, 10% any sort of high-level numbers or...
 
Steven M. Durels
SL Green Realty Corp. - Executive VP & Director of Leasing & Real Property
I don't have it at my fingertips, so it be pure speculation. It's something that I think we'll have -- when we're done with our budgets over
the next week or 2, we'll have a very good ability to communicate that. And perhaps that's something we'll talk about at investor
conferences as well.
 
Ronald Kamdem
Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Equity Analyst
So my second question was just on asset sales. I think you talked about -- historically about sort of potentially JV-ing One Vanderbilt.
Maybe can you talk about how that's going and are there other assets beyond that, that you're contemplating as well in the portfolio.
 
Andrew W. Mathias
SL Green Realty Corp. - President & Director
Well, we are marketing some assets for sale. We have other assets we're evaluating for sale. And the One Vanderbilt JV process is still
sort of in discussions. So we're active on the disposition front. We're going to use those proceeds to retire debt and to fund some of the
capital needs of some of the projects. And there's still an active market out there, as we showed with Memorial Sloan Kettering. And
there's a bunch of other trades that have happened in the market.
 
Marc Holliday
SL Green Realty Corp. - Chairman & CEO
I think on balance, we feel pretty good in our ability to execute, which is why we're basing our plan on redeployment of those proceeds. If
we feel good about those executions, then we have a different plan. But working hard and trying to convert and we got a lot done this
year. I referenced 24 sales transactions, either entire or partial interest, several of which were this year and more of which will be in the
next few quarters.
 
Operator
And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to management for any closing remarks.
 
Marc Holliday
SL Green Realty Corp. - Chairman & CEO
No. That's it. Thanks for whoever's left on the phone, appreciate you hanging in there for the duration. And we will see, I hope, many or
most or all of you on December 7th -- 5th, I'm sorry about that, on December 5th, Monday. See you then.
